Sampling activities were conducted in Italy to trace the source of Listeria monocytogenes contamination. The cheese that caused the outbreak was produced in a plant in Apulia that processed semi-finished cheeses supplied by five plants in Sardinia. During an 'emergency sampling', 179 (236%) out of 758 end-products tested positive for L. monocytogenes, with concentrations from <10 c.f.u./g to 11 x 10(6) c.f.u./g. Positive processing environment samples were found in two out of four processing plants. A 'follow-up sampling' was conducted 8 months later, when environmental samples from three out of six plants tested positive for L. monocytogenes and for Listeria spp. PFGE subtyping showed 100% similarity between US clinical strains and isolates from ricotta salata, confirming the origin of the outbreak. The persistence of strains in environmental niches of processing plants was demonstrated, and is probably the cause of product contamination. Two PFGE profiles from clinical cases of listeriosis in Italy in 2011, stored in the MSS-TESSy database, were found to have 100% similarity to one PFGE profile from a",

Frozen ready-to-eat vegetable samples, well as the plant environment, were sampled. The molecular subtyping techniques, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Restriction Endonuclease Analyses (REA), were performed to help investigate the origin and routes of Listeria dissemination. The low and sporadic incidence of L. monocytogenes made it impossible to establish an epidemiological sequence in the processing plant, though a case of cross-contamination between tomato and ratatouille was detected. Listeria innocua subtyping, however, allowed us to determine the prevalence of several strains in vegetables, and their presence on machinery samples suggested the possibility of cross-contamination during processing. The low incidence of L. monocytogenes indicated that the risk of listeriosis transmission by vegetable consumption is low. On the other hand, the isolation of the same strain of L. innocua in several surveys pointed out the risk of colonisation on surfaces and machinery. The persistence of Listeria spp. is a cause for concern as can lead to future contamination of vegetables processed in the plant and to a possible increased risk for health. Therefore, periodic controls for the presence of Listeria spp. and a further review of the cleaning and disinfection procedures used in frozen vegetable plants are recommended.",

The samples were collected pre- and during work from 3 areas (preparing, processing and packaging) to be examined for the bacterial count and isolation of food poisoning microorganisms (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes). All the pre-working samples were negative for bacterial count and isolation. The production area was significantly (P<0.05) lower in count for both workers and contact surface swabs than the other areas during work. For samples taken from workers, only S. aureus (1; 8.33%) was isolated from the preparing area, whereas other microorganisms could not be isolated. For contact surfaces, one strain (8.3%) each of E. coli and L. monocytogenes was isolated from the preparing area. E. coli (1; 8.3%) and L. monocytogenes (2; 16.7%) were isolated from fish samples in the preparing area. Salmonella could not be isolated from any sample. Raw materials were the most probable cause of contamination. None of the investigated microorganisms was isolated from the finished products. For such plant, it was recommended to verify the quality of purchased raw material and to decrease the intervals of sanitization programme to decrease the risk of cross contamination.",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous bacterium widely distributed in the environment that can cause a severe disease in humans when contaminated foods are ingested. Cheese has been implicated in sporadic cases and in outbreaks of listeriosis worldwide. Environmental contamination, in several occasions by persistent strains, has been considered an important source of finished product contamination. The objectives of this research were to (i) evaluate the presence of L. monocytogenes within the factory environments and cheeses of three processing plants, artisanal producer of raw ewe's milk cheeses (APC), small-scale industrial cheese producer (SSI) and industrial cheese producer (ICP) each producing a distinct style of cheese, all with history of contamination by L. monocytogenes (ii) and identify possible sources of contamination using different typing methods (arsenic and cadmium susceptibility, geno-serotyping, PFGE). The presence of markers specific for 3 epidemic clones (ECI-ECIII) of L. monocytogenes was also investigated. Samples were collected from raw milk (n = 179), whey (n = 3), cheese brining solution (n = 7), cheese brine sludge (n = 505), finished product (n = 3016), and environment (n = 2560) during, at least, a four-year period. Listeria monocytogenes was detected in environmental, raw milk and cheese samples, respectively, at 15.4%, 1.1% and 13.6% in APC; at 8.9%, 2.9% and 3.4% in SSI; and at 0%, 21.1% and 0.2% in ICP. Typing of isolates revealed that raw ewe's milk and the dairy plant environment are important sources of contamination, and that some strains persisted for at least four years in the environment. Although cheeses produced in the three plants investigated were never associated with any case or outbreak of listeriosis, some L. monocytogenes belonging to specific PFGE types that caused disease (including putative epidemic clone strains isolated from final products) were found in this study.",

Two lots were monitored. The frequency of raw fish samples containing L. monocytogenes was low. During processing, the frequency of fish contaminated with L. monocytogenes clearly rose after brining, and the most contaminated sites of the processing plant were the brining and postbrining areas. A total of 303 isolates from the raw fish, product, and the environment were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE yielded nine pulsotypes, which formed four clusters. The predominating L. monocytogenes pulsotypes of the final product were associated with brining and slicing, whereas contaminants of raw fish were not detected in the final product. Air-mediated contamination in the plant could not be proved. In accordance with these results, an L. monocytogenes eradication program was planned. The use of hot steam, hot air, and hot water seemed to be useful in eliminating L. monocytogenes. None of the control samples taken in the 5 months after the eradication program was implemented contained L. monocytogenes.",

All 14 individuals were older than 55 years, 12 were men, and 10 reported the presence of an underlying condition. All were resident in or had visited either of two English regions and were infected with the same strain of Listeria monocytogenes. In interviews with 12 patients, 9 reported eating pork pies, and individuals that consumed pork pies were significantly more likely to be infected with an outbreak strain than were individuals with sporadic cases of listeriosis infections in England from 2010 to 2012. Pork pies were purchased from seven retailers in South Yorkshire or the East Midlands, and the outbreak strain was recovered from pork pies supplied by only the producer in South Yorkshire. The outbreak strain was also recovered from samples of finished product and from environmental samples collected from the manufacturer. The likely source of contamination was environmental sites within the manufacturing environment, and the contamination was associated with the process of adding gelatin to the pies after cooking. Inadequate temperature control and poor hygienic practices at one of the retailers were also identified as possible contributory factors allowing growth of the pathogen. Following improvements in manufacturing practices and implementation of additional control measures at the retailers' premises, L. monocytogenes was not recovered from subsequent food and environmental samples, and the outbreak strain was not detected in further individuals with listeriosis in England.",

Two hundred twenty-three environmental samples were collected with sponges and swabs after each of the sanitization procedures, and 68 samples were collected during production. The total culturable aerobic plate count was determined for each sample, and a total of 288 bacterial strains were randomly isolated and tentatively identified to genus level by physiological and biochemical tests. The microflora was dominated by Neisseriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and lactic acid bacteria during production. Foam sanitization caused a change in the composition of the flora, with Pseudomonas spp. and Alcaligenes spp. being the dominant gram-negative bacteria and Kurthia spp. and Bacillus spp. being the surviving gram-positive bacteria. Bacteria were very sensitive to fog sanitization, and yeasts accounted for almost half of the surviving flora. By a selective isolation method, strains of L. monocytogenes were isolated and subsequently characterized by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) typing. Following foam sanitization, 14 to 42% of the samples contained <10 CFU per site, whereas 29 to 78% of the samples collected after fog sanitization contained this level of bacteria. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes was unchanged, but L. monocytogenes was found only in poorly cleaned areas such as drains. The RAPD types for all positive samples were identical to the type that had persisted in the smokehouse since 1995, indicating the importance of drains as a niche.",

            "abstractNote": "Pathogen environmental monitoring programs (EMPs) are essential for food processing facilities of all sizes that produce ready-to-eat food products exposed to the processing environment. We developed, implemented, and evaluated EMPs targeting Listeria spp. and Salmonella in nine small cheese processing facilities, including seven farmstead facilities. Individual EMPs with monthly sample collection protocols were designed specifically for each facility. Salmonella was detected in only one facility, with likely introduction from the adjacent farm indicated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data. Listeria spp. were isolated from all nine facilities during routine sampling. The overall Listeria spp. (other than Listeria monocytogenes) and L. monocytogenes prevalences in the 4,430 environmental samples collected were 6.03 and 1.35%, respectively. Molecular characterization and subtyping data suggested persistence of a given Listeria spp. strain in seven facilities and persistence of L. monocytogenes in four facilities. To assess routine sampling plans, validation sampling for Listeria spp. was performed in seven facilities after at least 6 months of routine sampling. This validation sampling was performed by independent individuals and included collection of 50 to 150 samples per facility, based on statistical sample size calculations. Two of the facilities had a significantly higher frequency of detection of Listeria spp. during the validation sampling than during routine sampling, whereas two other facilities had significantly lower frequencies of detection. This study provides a model for a science- and statistics-based approach to developing and validating pathogen EMPs.",

Each sample site was examined before and after a complete production shift. All samples were examined for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes, which was detected in floor drains on the raw product side of the plant preoperation and in drains on both raw and cooked sides following 8 h of processing operation. L. monocytogenes also was detected in raw product and once in fully cooked product but never on cooked product contact surfaces. One hundred sixty-one isolates were collected from 75 positive samples. All isolates were subtyped using a sequence-based method, and 14 unique subtypes were detected through the course of the study. Four of these types were found repeatedly and appeared to be resident in the plant. Three of the four resident strains were detected on raw product at some point during the year-long study, suggesting that raw product may be one source of L. monocytogenes in the processing plant environment. These data highlight the need for research to investigate why some types of L. monocytogenes persist in a processing plant environment but others do not.",

In a survey conducted at the processing facility, 40 environmental sites (encompassing 2 production lines and representing areas in which raw and cooked products are processed) were cultured for L.monocytogenes. The resulting isolates were subjected to molecular subtyping by ribotyping, and these isolates were compared with 25 isolates collected by plant personnel from product contact surfaces and from fully cooked product. 89 environmental and product isolates were divided into 15 distinct ribogroups. 2 ribogroups included isolates from fully cooked product; the members of these 2 ribogroups were subjected to further analysis by PFGE resulting in 4 clusters. L.monocytogenes isolates from fully cooked product produced on line 1 were found to be indistinguishable from isolates collected from drains on the raw-product side of line 1, and the floor surface in the cooked-product area of line 1. L.monocytogenes isolates from fully cooked product from line 2 were found to be indistinguishable from isolates collected from the spiral freezer exit conveyor on line 2, raw product contact surfaces on line 1, and drains in the cooked-product area of line 1. These data suggest that L.monocytogenes can colonize a poultry further processing facility and eventually be transferred to fully cooked product.",

To ascertain the colonization status of the plant, floor drains were sampled after a production shift and again after a cleanup shift on roughly a monthly basis for 21 months. Potential sources of L. monocytogenes to the plant included incoming raw meat, incoming fresh air, and personnel. Nearby environment and community samples were also examined. All L. monocytogenes detected were subjected to DNA sequence-based subtyping. L. monocytogenes was not detected in the plant before the commencement of processing operations. Within 4 months, several subtypes of L. monocytogenes were detected in floor drains, both before and after cleaning and sanitizing operations. No L. monocytogenes was detected on filters for incoming air, samples associated with plant employees, or a nearby discount shopping center. One subtype of L. monocytogenes was detected in a natural stream near the plant; however, this subtype was never detected inside the plant. Eight subtypes of L. monocytogenes were detected in raw meat staged for further processing; one of the raw meat subtypes was indistinguishable from a persistent drain subtype recovered after cleaning on eight occasions in four different drains. Poultry further processing plants are likely to become colonized with L. monocytogenes; raw product is an important source of the organism to the plant.",

Environmental sampling combined with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping and serotyping were applied to investigate the genetic diversity of L. monocytogenes in the plant environment and ready-to-eat (RTE) cold-smoked pork products. A total of 183 samples were collected for contamination analyses, including samples of the product at different stages during manufacture (n = 136) and environmental samples (a = 47) in 2009. L. monocytagenes isolates, previously recovered from 73 RTE cold-smoked pork samples and collected from the same meat processing plant in 2004, were included in this study. The brining machine and personnel working with brining procedures were the most contaminated places with L. monocytogenes. The overall prevalence of L. monocytogenes in raw pork (18%) increased to 60% after the brining injections. The brining machine harbored six different PFGE types belonging to serotypes 1/2a, 1/2c, 4b, and 4d, which were found on the feeding teeth, smooth surfaces, and spaces of the machine, thus potentially facilitating dissemination of L. monocytogenes contamination. Two PFGE types (2 and 8) belonging to serotypes 1/2a and 1/2c were recovered from RTE cold-smoked pork collected in 2004, and from surfaces of the brining machine sampled in 2009, and may indicate the presence of persistent L. monocytogenes strains in the plant. Due to poor hygiene design, removal of the brining machine from the production of cold-smoked meat products should be considered to reduce L. monocytogenes contamination in the finished products.",

The present study investigated the diversity of L. monocytogenes in a Swiss sandwich-producing plant over a 12-months period. L. monocytogenes were detected by culture after enrichment in 70 (3.5%) of 2028 environmental swabs and 16 (7.4%) of 217 samples from ingredients and sandwiches. Of the 86 L. monocytogenes strains, 93% belonged to serotype 1/2a and genetic lineage II. Rep PCR and PFGE analysis yielded each six profiles. Sixty-seven (77.9%) strains belonged to only one genotype, which was repeatedly found on/in slicers, conveyor belts, tables, a bread-feeding machine, spattles, air blow-guns, salmon, and egg sandwiches. Strains of this genotype persisted for more than 9 months in the processing environment, in particular on slicers and conveyor belts, which probably contributed to the contamination of sandwiches. After revision of the cleaning and disinfection procedures, L. monocytogenes were no longer found on slicers, conveyor belts, or in products. Besides, these results emphasize the importance of environmental monitoring schemes to identify potential contamination sources and as an early warning system for food business operators.

Samples (n=183), including food contact surfaces, non-food contact surfaces, raw materials and food samples, collected on four sampling occasions, were analysed for L. monocytogenes by the ISO 11290:1996 standard method and by real-time PCR applied to the second enrichment broth from the ISO method. No L. monocytogenes were detected on the first sampling occasion, but by the second sampling occasion a persistent clone had colonised the facility. Analysis of the second enrichment of the ISO method by real-time PCR was more sensitive for the detection of L. monocytogenes than the ISO method alone. In order to reduce the risk of cross contamination and the public health risk, awareness and proactive measures are required to control L. monocytogenes from the first days of production in a newly opened meat processing facility.",

A total of 2281 samples were collected before and during operation from areas of visible condensation, overhead pipes, and dripping pans in three plants each season during a one-year period. Significant interactions between season and plant type were observed for nearly all microorganisms, resulting in counts that were generally higher in the summer compared to other seasons. Aerobic plate counts ranged from non-detectable to 3.7log cfu100mL(-1) of condensation. Overall counts were so low that data had to be converted to results100mL(-1). Coliforms and Enterococci were not detectable in most condensation samples. Yeast and mold averaged less than 3.0log cfu100mL(-1) in all samples. Listeria spp. or Salmonella were each detected in only two samples. Condensation, present in harvest, fabrication, and RTE meat processing areas does not appear to contain microbial loads that will contaminate the product.",

Fifty milk samples (9 brands) and 55 MFC samples (10 brands) were tested from REs located in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil. All milk samples and 45 samples from 9 of 10 MFC brands tested negative for L. monocytogenes; however, \"brand F\" of MFC obtained from REs 119 and 159 tested positive. Thus, the farm/plant that produced brand F MFC was sampled; ail samples from the milking parlor tested negative for L. monocytogenes, whereas several sites within the processing plant and the MFC samples tested positive. All 344 isolates recovered from retail MFC, plant F MFC, and plant F environmental samples were serotype 1/2a and displayed the same AscI or ApaI fingerprints. Since these results established that the storage coolers served as the contamination source of the MFC, plant F was closed so that corrective renovations could be made. Following renovation, samples from sites that previously tested positive for the pathogen were collected from the processing environment and from MFC on multiple visits; all tested negative for L. monocytogenes. In addition, on subsequent visits to REs 159 and 119, all MFC samples tested negative for the pathogen. Studies are ongoing to quantify the prevalence, levels, and types of L. monocytogenes in MFC and associated processing plants to lessen the likelihood of listeriosis in Brazil.",

The guidance will discuss the need to conduct extensive investigative sampling when a potential harborage is identified, when to escalate LEMP activities, and when to consider finished product testing. Using these techniques over time with appropriate data analysis and corrective actions will help to reduce the likelihood of contamination of product with L. monocytogenes and thus reduce overall incidence of consumer illness.",

This method couples local plant teams with investigative tools and a list of critical factors for process control.

Once the plant is in the Pre - ventative and Predictive phases efforts spent firefighting problems are dramatically reduced and a state of control evolves.",

            "abstractNote": "This study was designed to determine the presences of two environmental pathogens in two dairy factories in Sakarya, Turkey. A total of 264 environmental samples, raw milk and cheese samples were taken at four different seasons. According to the results, Listeria monocytogenes or Escherichia colt O157:H7 was isolated from 26 or 2.7% of the samples collected from both factories, respectively. None of the cheese or curd samples were found to be positive for Listeria or E. coli O157:H7. However, 50% of raw milk samples contained Listeria innocua. Listeria was mostly isolated from the swap samples taken from the drains or the floors in processing or packaging areas. However, E. colt was also isolated from the swap samples taken from the workers' hands and gloves as well as the drains and the floor. Only one raw milk sample contained E. coli O157:H7. A higher prevalence of both pathogens was observed in the summer months than in the other months. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The present study aimed to detect L. monocytogenes in a beef-processing facility, investigating the diversity of serotypes and pulsotypes in order to identify the possible contamination routes. Surface samples from knives (n=26), tables (n=78), and employees hands (n=74) were collected before and during the procedures from a beef-processing facility, in addition to surface samples of end cuts: round (n=32), loin (n=30), and chuck (n=32). All samples were subjected to L. monocytogenes screening according ISO 11.290-1, and the obtained isolates were subjected to serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Listeria spp. were identified in all processing steps, in 61 samples, and L. monocytogenes was detected in 17 samples, not being found only in knives. Eighty-five isolates were identified as L. monocytogenes, from serotypes 1/2c (n=65), 4b (n=13), and 1/2b (n=7), being grouped in 19 pulsotypes. Considering these results, cross-contamination among hands, tables, and beef cuts could be identified. The obtained data indicated the relevance of cross-contamination in the beef-processing facility, and the occurrence of serotypes 1/2b and 4b in beef cuts distributed for retail sale is a public health concern.",

Concentrations of L. monocytogenes were determined using a most-probable-number (MPN) enrichment procedure. Two floor drains had persistent low concentrations of L. monocytogenes (0.03 to >1,100 MPN/cm2). In comparison, concentrations of the other organisms in the drain were much higher (heterotrophic plate count range of 10(5) to 10(8) CFU/cm2). Concentrations of environmental organisms (heterotrophic aerobic plate counts and counts of pseudomonads, Shewanella spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, and coliforms) were not correlated with concentrations of L. monocytogenes. The 178 confirmed L. monocytogenes isolates from the MPN procedure were further characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Sixteen different banding patterns were identified, and nine of the patterns were identified from samples collected on two or more collection dates. From all locations, banding type A was observed in 98 confirmed isolates (55%). Although present, L. monocytogenes was a relatively minor component in the ecosystem of the floor drains in this seafood-processing facility.",

It was thus agreed that the EURL L. monocytogenes would write a guidance document on this topic, in collaboration with a working group (WG). This WG comprised 20 members from 7 EU Member States (MSs), belonging to 3 NRLs and other organizations (see front page). Apart from the literature review and the contributions from the WG members, these guidelines were based on a large survey conducted in 2010 on surface sampling practices (137 respondent s from 15 EU MSs, belonging to FBOs, service providers in charge of hygiene control, official control services,...), which showed a great variety of practices and some wrong ones, emphasizing the need of a European document. Several drafts have been prepared, each submitted to a consultation of, in a first step, all NRLs which consulted at national level operators practicing surface sampling, and then the WG members. The current version 3 results from an agreement of all NRLs at their annual workshop on 28-30 March 2012 and takes into comments received from 3 EU MSs (UK, NL, DE), in the frame of a MS consultation made by DG SANCO. This version has been agreed by the EU MSs’ Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health at its meeting of 18 July 2012 and a further written 2-week consultation.",

Evidence from studies in processing plants shows that the factors associated with the presence of L. monocytogenes are those that favor growth. Interestingly, most conditions promoting bacterial growth were shown, in laboratory assays, to decrease adhesion of L. monocytogenes cells. Good growth conditions can be found in so-called harborage sites, i.e. shelters due to unhygienic design of equipment and premises or unhygienic or damaged materials. These sites are hard to eliminate. A conceptual model of persistence/no persistence based on the relative weight of growth vs. outcome of cleaning and disinfection is suggested. It shows that a minimum initial bacterial load is necessary for bacteria to persist in a harborage site and that when a low initial bacterial charge is applied, early cleaning and disinfection is the only way to avoid persistence. We conclude by proposing that there are no strains of L. monocytogenes with unique properties that lead to persistence, but harborage sites in food industry premises and equipment where L. monocytogenes can persist.",

This investigation evaluates the relationships between microbiological controls, the hygienic quality of processing environments, the quality of carcasses and their safety by monitoring Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157: H7 contamination. During one year, the research was developed in a slaughterhouse, enabled to export, located in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Total Viable Count (TVC) results in food-contact surfaces were often close to those found in the literature. Statistical differences were found when factors such as specific months, seasons, different abattoir areas or abattoir and surfaces sampled were analyzed. The most critical factors were, respectively, hot and rainy months, wet season, slaughter-room and aprons, each with high unacceptable results. A high rate of environment samples was positive for Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes. The carcass counts for E. coli are shown to be largely satisfactory and lower than rates registered in most studies. Although TVC rates in carcasses were lower than those found in the literature, no results were rated as unsatisfactory. E. coli O157: H7 and Salmonella spp. were not identified in any carcass sample. The findings favorably manifest efficacy in hygienic-sanitary controls and confirm the right choice of procedures within the HACCP plan which prevent important pathogens to reach carcasses' surface.",

Identification of Listeria spp. other than L. monocytogenes was not made. Milk processing plants were categorized as to type of product produced and subdivided into areas based on manufacturing activity occurring in that area. A total of 597 environmental samples from 156 plants were analyzed in the six month period of January through July 1987. Listeria spp. were isolated from 75 (12.6%) of the samples. Thirty-eight of the Listeria spp. (50.7%) were identified as L. monocytogenes. Forty-six plants (29.5%) yielded positive results for Listeria spp., of which, 31 plants (19.9%) were positive for L. monocytogenes. Listeria was recovered more frequently from fluid milk product plants and frozen milk product plants. Likewise, Listeria was isolated most frequently from the packaging-filling room location within a plant and least frequently from the raw milk receiving room. Although Listeria spp. was isolated most frequently from the conveyor site, the drain site within a plant location gave a Listeria isolation rate similar to the total number of Listeria positive sites within that plant location.",

Methods and Results: Five hundred and two isolates of L. monocytogenes were collected and characterized by genotyping and serotyping. Thirty-seven genotypes were obtained by ApaI-restriction analysis-pulsed field gel electrophoresis (REA-PFGE) and 35 by SmaI-REA-PFGE and resulted in 50 combined genotypes. The tracing of the contamination in both plants showed that some clones were able to survive for several months. However, some other clones were found only during processing operations, were not detectable after cleaning and seemed to enter continuously into the plant. Conclusions: Some L. monocytogenes strains may persist for a long period in the plant environment. Different genotypes can be associated with poultry as well as pork meat. Significance and Impact of the Study: Listeria monocytogenes contamination can be due to contaminated raw materials, bacterial spread and also ineffective cleaning procedures.",

Among 315 samples, prevalence of L. monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and a group of Listeria seeligeri–Listeria welshimeri–Listeria ivanovii was 21.6, 13.0 and 29.5%, respectively. No Listeria grayi was detected in this survey. While no L. monocytogenes strains were isolated from catfish skins and intestines, the strains were found with a frequency of 76.7% in chilled fresh catfish fillets and 43.3% in unchilled fillets. L. monocytogenes and Listeria spp. were also detected in fish contact surfaces such as deheading machine, trimming board, chiller water, conveyor belts at different stages, and fillet weighing table. Among L. monocytogenes, 1/2b (47.0%), 3b (16.0%) and 4c (14%) were the predominant serotypes isolated, whereas 4b, 4e, 1/2c and 1/2a were detected at much lower frequencies. Genotype analyses of L. monocytogenes isolates using serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR revealed that chiller water represented an important contamination source of L. monocytogenes in the chilled catfish fillets of two processing facilities, whereas fillet weighing table significantly contributed to the catfish fillet contamination of the third facility. This study suggests that L. monocytogenes contamination in the processed catfish fillets originates from the processing environment, rather than directly from catfish. Results from this study can aid the catfish industry to develop a plant-specific proper cleaning and sanitation procedure for equipment and the processing environment designed to specifically target L. monocytogenes contamination.",

            "abstractNote": "Incidence of Listeria spp. in whole raw catfish, catfish fillets, and processing environments from two catfish processing facilities was determined in August 2008 and August 2009. Thirty-nine (18.4%) of 212 samples collected in August 2008 were positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Prevalences of Listeria species L. innocua and L. seeligeri-L. welshimeri-L. ivanovii were 11.3 and 23.6%, respectively. Of 209 samples collected in August 2009, 12.4% were positive for L. monocytogenes, 11% for L. innocua, and 19.6% for L. seeligeri-L. welshimeri-L. ivanovii. No Listeria grayi was detected in any of the samples. L. monocytogenes was not found in catfish skins and intestines, but was detected in catfish fillets, on food contact surfaces, and on non-food contact surfaces with frequencies of 45.0, 12.0, and 11.1%, respectively. In August 2008 isolates, serotypes 1/2b (62.2%) and 3b (15.6%) were frequently isolated, whereas the majority of the August 2009 isolates (92.3%) were serotype 1/2b. Genotyping analyses revealed that some genotypes of L. monocytogenes isolates were detected in one facility even after a year, but no persistence of L. monocytogenes was observed in the other facility. In addition, some L. monocytogenes isolates from fresh fillets showed genotypes that were either identical, or more than 90% similar, to those of L. monocytogenes isolates from food contact surfaces in the processing lines. The results of this study suggest that processing environment rather than whole raw catfish is an important source of L. monocytogenes contamination in the catfish fillets. These results should assist the catfish industry to develop better control and prevention strategies for L. monocytogenes.",

            "abstractNote": "The emergence of microorganisms exerting resistance to biocides is a challenge to meat-processing environments. Bacteria can be intrinsically resistant to biocides but resistance can also be acquired by adaptation to their sub-lethal concentrations. Moreover, the presence of biocide resistance determinants, which is closely linked to antibiotic resistance determinants, could lead to co-selection during disinfection practices along the food chain, and select cross-resistant foodborne pathogens. The purpose of this work was to test the resistance of wild strains of Listeria monocytogenes, isolated from pork meat processing plants, toward benzalkonium chloride (BC), used as proxy of quaternary ammonium compounds. Furthermore, the expression of two non-specific efflux pumps genes (lde and mdrL) under biocide exposure was evaluated. L. monocytogenes were isolated from five processing plants located in the Veneto region (northeast of Italy) before and after cleaning and disinfection (C&D) procedures. A total of 45 strains were collected: 36 strains before and nine after the C&D procedures. Collected strains were typed according to MLST and ERIC profiles. Strains sampled in the same site, isolated before, and after the C&D procedures and displaying the same MLST and ERIC profiles were tested for their sensitivity to different concentrations of BC, in a time course assay. The expression of non-specific efflux pumps was evaluated at each time point by qPCR using tufA gene as housekeeping. A differential expression of the two investigated genes was observed: lde was found to be more expressed by the strains isolated before C&D procedures while its expression was dose-dependent in the case of the post C&D procedures strain. On the contrary, the expression of mdrL was inhibited under low biocidal stress (10 ppm BC) and enhanced in the presence of high stress (100 ppm BC). These findings suggests a possible role for C&D procedures to select L. monocytogenes persisters, pointing out the importance of dealing with the identification of risk factors in food plants sanification procedures that might select more tolerant strains.",

            "abstractNote": "In Sardinia, ewe's milk is almost exclusively used for cheese manufacture, and it is usually processed in small dairies which do not have sufficient technical and scientific knowledge for large-scale controlled production. This study was carried out to identify the sources of contamination and the kinds of contaminating microorganisms present in six ewe's milk processing plants in Sardinia. Samples were collected during production hours three times over a period of 6 months. Raw milk, heat-treated milk, curd, 30-day-old cheese, lactic culture, rennet, and water used in processing lines were analyzed and the microbial contamination of air and surfaces was evaluated. Total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, Escherichia coli, gram-negative psychrotrophs, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Listeria spp., yeasts, and molds were determined. Our survey confirmed that the production of food of high microbiological quality is strictly dependent on the microbiological quality of the raw material, optimization of the parameters for the heat treatment, water of potable quality, well-defined cleaning and disinfection procedures, and properly hygienic processing conditions. In fact, only plants characterized by raw milk and rennet of acceptable quality, generally clean work surfaces, and low microbial counts in the air of working areas made finished products of high microbiological quality. Standardization of technological parameters and achievement of properly hygienic processing conditions will help minimize the risk of developing food-safety problems, in compliance with public health regulatory requirements. These actions would help guarantee an adequate quality of Sardinian ewe's milk cheeses and might also lead to access to the international market.",

Salmonella spp. were not isolated from any of the environmental samples. Yersinia enterocolitica was isolated from 6.8% of the environmental samples. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from 6.5% of the environmental samples. Listeria spp. other than L. monocytogenes were isolated from 9.3% of the environmental samples. The presence of Y. enterocolitica was significantly related to high bacterial counts for six microbiological tests. The presence of L. monocytogenes was not related to high bacterial counts.",

            "abstractNote": "The occurrence of Listeria spp. was investigated in 17 food factories (representing six different product groups), 35 Dutch households and in a sawmill. The aim of this study was to assess their distribution in these environments, possible measures for their control and the likelihood of human exposure to these organisms from sources other than foods or faeces. In food factories, listerias were found in drains, floors, standing water, residues and food-contact surfaces in descending order of frequency. In two dry culinary food units, no samples were found to be contaminated. These results indicate that dry conditions and the restriction of food residues contribute to the control of these organisms. From kitchens in 35 households chosen at random, seven (20%) were found to be contaminated with listerias. They were isolated from refrigerators (one swab), dish cloths (six from seven samples) and from two dustbins. It seems that dish cloths could be an important source of these organisms in the home. In the environment of the sawmill, L. ivanovii was isolated more frequently than any other species. This was interpreted in terms of the availability of xylose, a wood breakdown product, in such environments. Although listeriosis outbreaks have been associated with foods, most cases are of unknown origin. This study indicates that listerias are common in many environments and that epidemiological studies should concentrate on these as well as foods. In view of the large number of sources of listerias in the natural environment, the domestic environment and in raw foods prepared in the home, human beings are exposed to these organisms on a regular basis. Scrupulous personal and domestic hygiene to diminish cross-contamination could be an important factor in the prevention of human listeriosis.",

This microorganism can survive processing steps such as curing and cold smoking and is capable of growing under refrigeration temperatures. Its presence in RTE fish products with extended shelf life may be a risk to the susceptible population. One example of such a product is gravlax salmon; a refrigerated fish product not exposed to listericidal processes and was the subject of this study. In order to evaluate the incidence and dissemination of L. monocytogenes 415 samples were collected at different steps of a gravlax salmon processing line in Sao Paulo state, Brazil. L. monocytogenes was confirmed in salmon samples (41%), food contact surfaces (32%), non-food contact surfaces (43%) and of food handlers samples (34%), but could not be detected in any ingredient. 179 L. monocytogenes isolates randomly selected were serogrouped and typed by PFGE. Most of L. monocytogenes strains belonged to serogroup 1 (73%).",

Environmental samples (n = 705) were examined for the presence of Listeria spp. by using three detection/isolation protocols. The use of dual enrichment methods, which allowed for the recovery of injured Listeria spp. (mUSDA). identified more Listeria species-positive samples with higher sensitivity than the standard USDA method. The addition of PCR to the mUSDA method identified the most Listeria monocytogenes-positive samples, achieving greater sensitivity of detection while Substantially reducing time. Overall, 7.5% of samples were positive for Listeria spp.. yielding 7 10 isolates. 253 of which were subtyped by automated ribotyping to examine strain diversity within and between plants over time. The isolation of specific ribotypes and not appear to be affected by the enrichment protocol used. Fifteen (2.1%) samples yielded L. monocytogenes isolates differentiated almost equally into ribotypes of lineages I and II. Of most concern was the persistent and widespread contamination of a plant with L. monocytogenes DUP-1042B. a ribotype previously associated with multiple outbreaks of listeriosis. Our results suggest that the extent of contamination by Listeria spp., notably L. monocytogenes, in farmstead cheese plants is comparatively, low. especially, for those with on-site farms. The results of this study also identified points of control for use in designing more effective Listeria spp. control and monitoring programs with a focus on ribotypes of epidemiological significance.",

Samples (n = 236) from 86 food contact surfaces and 150 non-food contact surfaces were examined for the presence of Listeria spp. by comparing the efficacy of three different primary enrichment media used in five detection and isolation methods. University of Vermont broth was the most sensitive primary enrichment medium for the detection of Listeria spp., including Listeria monocytogenes. These results, however, did not differ significantly from those obtained with Listeria repair broth or Oxoid 24 Listeria enrichment broth. When full methods were considered, the use of dual enrichment methods identified the most Listeria spp.-positive samples, whereas the BAX System PCR Assay for the Genus Listeria 24E provided the most rapid results (âˆơ30 h). Cultural results from the direct plating of secondary enrichment broths were generally in agreement with PCR results when compared within methods. Despite minor differences in efficacy, all five methods were in agreement with one another. Overall, 24 (10.7%) of the 236 environmental samples were positive for Listeria spp., all of which were collected from non-food contact surfaces. Nine of these sites were also positive in previous sampling events, suggesting that these sites serve as Listeria niches and that certain ribotypes are particularly persistent, inhabiting environments and specific sites for over 2 years. Overall, our results suggest that the extent of Listeria spp. contamination, notably L. monocytogenes, in small-scale artisan cheese processing environments is low.",

The control of these strains is thus essential to ensure food safety. In the present study, 205 samples were collected from a food processing facility between May 2012 to February 2013 and analysed for the presence of L. monocytogenes by the IS011290 standard method. L. monocytogenes isolates were differentiated using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Up to 55% of the samples were positive for L. monocytogenes until October 2012. Advice was given on the implementation of corrective actions regarding cleaning and disinfection procedures and workflows. This resulted in a decrease in the number of positive samples, reflecting the reduction of L. monocytogenes in the processing environment. Eight pulsotypes were found in the food processing facility environment, mainly on non-food contact surfaces. One type was identified as persistent as it was isolated on each sampling occasion and constituted more than 71% of the isolates collected. It was the only type found in the processing environment after the implementation of corrective actions. This work demonstrates that processing environment sampling plans are effective to assess hygiene and implement corrective actions. This contributes to prevention of contamination events and consequently to assuring the safety of the food product.",

Even in the case of hard-cheese such as Cheddar cheese, the absence of growth of List. monocytogenes during ripening has to be demonstrated to comply with EU legislation. Studies dedicated to assessing List. monocytogenes growth throughout cheese shelf-life are generally based on artificially contaminated cheeses. Contrary to the majority of works, the current study focused on the growth of List. monocytogenes in naturally contaminated raw milk farmhouse Cheddar cheeses during a five-month ripening period. List. monocytogenes growth was assessed by direct count and its presence was detected by enrichment in two naturally contaminated cheese batches. In order to track routes of contamination, 199 processing environment samples from inside and outside the processing facility were taken, and their analysis for the presence of List. monocytogenes was performed on four occasions over a 9-month period. List. monocytogenes isolates were differentiated using PFGE and serotyping. List. monocytogenes never exceeded 20cfu/g in the cheeses and could not be detected after five months of ripening. Eleven pulsotypes were identified. One pulsotype was found in the yard outside the processing facility, in a vat, on the processing area floor and in a cheese. This indicated that the outside environment constitutes a potential source of contamination of the processing environment and of the cheese. These results demonstrate that this farmhouse Cheddar cheese does not support List. monocytogenes growth and suggests that the efforts to reduce processing environment contamination are worthwhile.",

            "abstractNote": "Analysis for Listeria monocytogenes by ISO11290-1 is time-consuming, entailing two enrichment steps and subsequent plating on agar plates, taking five days without isolate confirmation. The aim of this study was to determine if a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay could be used for analysis of the first and second enrichment broths, saving four or two days, respectively. In a comprehensive approach involving six European laboratories, PCR and traditional plating of both enrichment broths from the ISO11290-1 method were compared for the detection of L monocytogenes in 872 food, raw material and processing environment samples from 13 different dairy and meat food chains. After the first and second enrichments, total DNA was extracted from the enriched cultures and analysed for the presence of L monocytogenes DNA by PCR. DNA extraction by chaotropic solid-phase extraction (spin column-based silica) combined with real-time PCR (RTi-PCR) was required as it was shown that crude DNA extraction applying sonication lysis and boiling followed by traditional gel-based PCR resulted in fewer positive results than plating. The RTi-PCR results were compared to plating, as defined by the ISO11290-1 method. For first and second enrichments, 90% of the samples gave the same results by RTi-PCR and plating, whatever the RTi-PCR method used. For the samples that gave different results, plating was significantly more accurate for detection of positive samples than RTi-PCR from the first enrichment, but RTi-PCR detected a greater number of positive samples than plating from the second enrichment, regardless of the RTi-PCR method used. RTi-PCR was more accurate for non-food contact surface and food contact surface samples than for food and raw material samples especially from the first enrichment, probably because of sample matrix interference. Even though RTi-PCR analysis of the first enrichment showed less positive results than plating, in outbreak scenarios where a rapid result is required, RTi-PCR could be an efficient way to get a preliminary result to be then confirmed by plating. Using DNA extraction from the second enrichment broth followed by RTi-PCR was reliable and a confirmed result could be obtained in three days, as against seven days by ISO11290-1.

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: After an outbreak of gastroenteritis and fever among persons who attended a picnic in Illinois, chocolate milk served at the picnic was found to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. METHODS: In investigating this outbreak, we interviewed the people who attended the picnic about what they ate and their symptoms. Surveillance for invasive listeriosis was initiated in the states that receive milk from the implicated dairy. Stool and milk samples were cultured for L. monocytogenes. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibody to listeriolysin O. RESULTS: Forty-five persons had symptoms that met the case definition for illness due to L. monocytogenes, and cultures of stool from 11 persons yielded the organism. Illness in the week after the picnic was associated with the consumption of chocolate milk. The most common symptoms were diarrhea (present in 79 percent of the cases) and fever (72 percent). Four persons were hospitalized. The median incubation period for infection was 20 hours (range, 9 to 32), and persons who became ill had elevated levels of antibody to listeriolysin O. Isolates from stool specimens from patients who became ill after the picnic, from sterile sites in three additional patients identified by surveillance, from the implicated chocolate milk, and from a tank drain at the dairy were all serotype 1/2b and were indistinguishable on multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, ribotyping, and DNA macrorestriction analysis. CONCLUSIONS: L. monocytogenes is a cause of gastroenteritis with fever, and sporadic cases of invasive listeriosis may be due to unrecognized outbreaks caused by contaminated food.",

            "abstractNote": "A cold-smoked salmon factory was surveyed for a period of 1 year (2008-2009) for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in the processing line, processing environment, personnel, raw materials and product (cold-smoked salmon). The purpose of the study was to determine whether genetically similar strains colonise different environmental niches in the processing factory and thereby determining the possible contamination source or pathways. The processing factory was divided into four zones (1-4) based on the proximity to the samples. The overall prevalence of L monocytogenes was 24.54% (n = 444). The L monocytogenes contamination pattern was identified by characterising 124 L monocytogenes isolates (obtained from this survey) by Multiple Locus Variable number tandem repeats Analysis (MLVA). The isolates were divided into 8 MLVA types (Lm a, Lm b, Lm c, Lm d, Lm e, Lm f, Lm g and Lm i). The final product (cold-smoked salmon) was contaminated with two major types of L monocytogenes; one type originating from the raw material (Lm a) and the other type colonising the production line (Lm c) in zone 1. This suggests that, in addition to the fish processing line, L. monocytogenes contaminated raw material can progress through the production chain and result in contamination of the final product. Each zone had one dominating strain type, thus leading to the hypothesis that specific L monocytogenes strains may be better adapted to specific environmental niches in the processing factory. The results clearly indicated the problematic sites which were the raw material, cutting board, drains, floor, conveyer belt and slicer/skinner equipment. Although, these areas would be rigorously cleaned before the start of the production, there seems to be the existence of resistant L monocytogenes strain types. In order to minimise the problem observed in this study, new cleaning and disinfection protocols should be considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Of the 141 samples collected from three processing plants, 59 (42%) were contaminated with L. monocytogenes. The rates of contamination varied as to the plant and the sample source. L. monocytogenes isolates from 17 various contaminated seafood products (fresh, frozen and smoked fishes, cooked mussels) were also studied. A total of 155 isolates from the three plants and the various seafoods were characterized by genomic macrorestriction using ApaI and SmaI with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and 82 isolates were serotyped. Macrorestriction yielded 20 pulsotypes and serotyping yielded four serovars: 1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 4b (or e), with 77 (93%) belonging to serovar 1/2a. One clone of L. monocytogenes predominated and persisted in plant I and was the only pulsotype detected in the final product although it was not isolated from raw salmon. No L. monocytogenes was detected in the smoked skinned salmon processed in plant II, even though 87% of the raw salmon was contaminated. All the smoked salmon samples collected in plant III were contaminated with a unique clone of L. monocytogenes, which may have occurred during slicing. In the three plants, the contamination of final products did not seem to originate from the L. monocytogenes present on raw salmon, but from the processing environment.",

            "abstractNote": "In March 2005, Listeria monocytogenes was detected on the rinds of Taleggio cheeses produced in an Italian plant. To identify the pathogen source, 154 rinds of cheeses that had been manually and automatically salinated and 52 environmental swabs collected from salting equipment, ripening cloths, and ripening boxes were tested for L. monocytogenes. Twenty-seven strains isolated from cheese samples and 16 strains isolated from environmental samples were genotyped by EcoRI and PvuII automated ribotyping. The microbiological results revealed a significant incidence of contamination of cheeses that were automatically salinated and contamination on the salting equipment, ripening cloths, and boxes. All cheese and environmental strains had the same EcoRI and PvuII ribotyping profiles, designated 153-204-S5 and 153-210-S-2, respectively. The only exception were three Taleggio strains, isolated from the same lot of product, that had EcoRI and PvuII ribotyping profiles designated 153-289-S6 and 153-214-S-5, respectively. Strains with EcoRI profile 153-204-S5 were classified as DUP-ID 1045 and serotype 1/2a, whereas strains with EcoRI profile 153-289-S6 were classified as DUP-ID 1034 and serotype 1/2b. The microbiological and molecular typing data collected in this study suggest that the source of the L. monocytogenes contamination in the Taleggio plant under study was the automated salting equipment. The isolate DUP-IDs were used to trace the introduction of potentially dangerous strains, such as those characterized as DUP-ID 1034, in the processing plant.",

            "abstractNote": "The aim of the,present study was to investigate the sources of Listeria monocytogenes contamination in a cold smoked salmon processing environment over a period of six years (2003-2008). A total of 170 samples of raw material, semi-processed, final product and processing surfaces at different production stages were tested for the presence of L. monocytogenes. The L monocytogenes isolates were characterized by multiplex PCR for the analysis of virulence factors and for serogrouping. The routes of contamination over the six year period were traced by PFGE. L monocytogenes was isolated from 24% of the raw salmon samples, 14% of the semi-processed products and 12% of the final products. Among the environmental samples, 16% were positive for L monocytogenes. Serotyping yielded three serovars: 1/2a, 1/2b, 4b, with the majority belonging to serovars 1/2a (46%) and 1/2b (39%). PFGE yielded 14 profiles: two of them were repeatedly isolated in 2005-2006 and in 2007-2008 mainly from the processing environment and final products but also from raw materials. The results of this longitudinal study highlighted that contamination of smoked salmon occurs mainly during processing rather than originating from raw materials, even if raw fish can be a contamination source of the working environment. Molecular subtyping is critical for the identification of the contamination routes of L. monocytogenes and its niches into the production plant when control strategies must be implemented with the aim to reduce its prevalence during manufacturing.

Such outbreaks affirm the need for improved testing, environmental monitoring, and epidemiological surveillance. This paper reviews the entry of microbial pathogens into foods, with an emphasis on dairy products, by examining the contribution of the processing environment to microbial contamination. Numerous surveys, including a recent audit of dairy processing plants in Vermont, have revealed common foci of environmental contamination by Listeria and Yersinia persistent within dairy processing environments. With respect to dairy products, the bacterial pathogens discussed in this manuscript share a common source, raw milk. Characteristics possessed by Salmonella, Listeria, and Yersinia are compared and contrasted. In the case of Listeria, this bacterium's role as a newly emerged foodborne pathogen is discussed. Finally, the economic consequences associated with foodborne disease are highlighted, and future prospects related to foodborne illness are presented.",

Listeria were isolated by a standard enrichment procedure from chicken carcass neck skins sampled at six points during processing and from swabs of two equipment surfaces. The survey was repeated five times at monthly intervals (July-November). Isolates from Listeria positive samples were identified to species level and plasmid profiles of each isolate were determined. Listeria innocua was detected on the rubber fingers of the plucking machines and all neck skin samples after evisceration. Listeria monocytogenes strains were detected on the rubber fingers, packaging funnel and all neck skins after spin chilling. Of the Listeria species isolated, 77.2% corresponded to 1 of 2 different plasmid profile types which were distributed throughout all the Listeria positive sampling points. The frequency of occurrence of both species varied from month to month, but both predominant plasmid profile types occurred whenever Listeria positive samples were found. It was concluded that Listeria contamination of carcasses in the plant was due to faecal or gut contamination from the chickens or the presence of endemic Listeria strains.",

            "abstractNote": "Sanitation protocols are applied on a daily basis in food processing facilities to prevent the risk of cross-contamination with spoilage organisms. Floor drain water serves along with product-associated samples (slicer dust, brine or cheese smear) as an important hygiene indicator in monitoring Listeria monocytogenes in food processing facilities. Microbial communities of floor drains are representative for each processing area and are influenced to a large degree by food residues, liquid effluents and washing water. The microbial communities of drain water are steadily changing, whereas drain biofilms provide more stable niches. Bacterial communities of four floor drains were characterized using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to better understand the composition and exchange of drain water and drain biofilm communities. Furthermore, the L. monocytogenes contamination status of each floor drain was determined by applying cultivation-independent real-time PCR quantification and cultivation-dependent detection according to ISO11290-1. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes of drain water and drain biofilm bacterial communities yielded 50,611 reads, which were clustered into 641 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), affiliated to 16 phyla dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The most abundant OTUs represented either product- (Lactococcus lactis) or fermentation- and food spoilage-associated phylotypes (Pseudomonas mucidolens, Pseudomonas fragi, Leuconostoc citreum, and Acetobacter tropicalis). The microbial communities in DW and DB samples were distinct in each sample type and throughout the whole processing plant, indicating the presence of indigenous specific microbial communities in each processing compartment. The microbiota of drain biofilms was largely different from the microbiota of the drain water. A sampling approach based on drain water alone may thus only provide reliable information on planktonic bacterial cells but might not allow conclusions on the bacterial composition of the microbiota in biofilms.",

Each of 3 blast chillers was sampled for Listeria species from Monday to Friday over a 2-yr period, 12 months pre- and 12 months post-commencement of intervention, amounting to 490 samples per blast chiller per yr. Over the 2 yr, a total of 2940 blast chiller environmental samples were drawn. Similarly, each of 2 holding chillers was sampled for Listeria species from Monday to Friday over the 2-yr period, 16 months pre- and 8 months post-commencement of intervention, amounting to 919 samples per holding chiller over the 16 months preintervention, and 551 samples per holding chiller over 8 months post intervention. Over the 2 yr, there was a total of 2940 holding chiller environmental samples drawn. Although Listeria was not eliminated from chillers, even 1 yr after intervention, there was a statistically significant (P <0.001) reduction in the prevalence of Listeria in all chillers. No deleterious effects of heating were noted in wall panelling, seals, synthetic floors or chilling equipment. The air heating regimen was readily incorporated by sanitation staff into the existing Good Manufacturing Practice programme. Results suggest the application of chiller air heating may result in significant reductions in the prevalence of Listeria in chillers.",

            "abstractNote": "Cold-smoked salmon processing plants were surveyed to determine the occurrence and sources of L. monocytogenes contamination. Sanitation and cleanup procedures adequately eliminated L. monocytogenes from the processing line and equipment, but recontamination occurred soon after resumption of processing. The primary source of contamination proved to be the surface areas of frozen or fresh raw fish coming into the plant. Listeria species were not isolated from the flesh except when they were introduced during the filleting operation, by the injection of recirculated brine, or in localized areas where there were pre-existing bruises. Penetration of L. monocytogenes into intact flesh via the vascular system did not occur when fresh fish were immobilized with carbon dioxide and bled, nor when frozen, headed, and eviscerated fish were thawed for 20 h in water inoculated with 44 L. monocytogenes organisms per ml. Populations of L. monocytogenes inoculated onto the surface of brined salmon portions changed very little during a cold-smoke process at 72 to 87 degrees F (22.2 to 30.6 degrees C) for 20 h, with or without applied smoke; but when the processing temperature was lowered to 63 to 70 degrees F (17.2 to 21.1 degrees C), populations decreased 10- to 25-fold when smoke was applied. L. monocytogenes injected into the interior of these portions increased 2- to 6-fold at 63 to 70 degrees F (17.2 to 21.1 degrees C) and 100-fold at 72 to 87 degrees F (22.2 to 30.6 degrees C), regardless of the presence of smoke. L. monocytogenes was enumerated in 48 contaminated finished products collected from six different processing plants. L. monocytogenes populations ranged from 0.3 to 34.3 cells per g, with a mean of 6.2 per g and a median of 3.2 per g.",

            "abstractNote": "Refrigeration systems in chilled rooms in 15 plants processing a variety of foods were studied. These included plants processing raw meat and salads, Chinese ready meals, dairy products, slicing and packing of cooked meats and catering establishments. An initial survey of total numbers of microbes at a total of 891 sites on evaporators, drip trays and chilled room walls was followed up with a more detailed examination of 336 sites with high counts, selecting for Listeria spp., coliforms, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Temperatures (particularly air on and air off, maximum and near defrost heaters) relative humidity, airflow, layout and cleaning regimes were surveyed. In general, no correlation could be found between any of the physical measurements and the numbers and types of bacteria detected. Maximum mean temperatures in the chilled rooms varied from -1 to +16.9℗'C and few chilled units were regularly cleaned. Twenty five percent of sites examined had more than 10âæ colony-forming units per cm2, although, very few pathogens or faecal indicator bacteria were detected. Listeria spp. were not found and coliforms were found only once, in low numbers. Low numbers of S. aureus or B. cereus were present in 9 of the 15 plants, B. cereus was found on evaporators and associated drip trays in two catering plants and two plants processing cooked meat. Enterococci and S. aureus were found most frequently in a raw red meat slaughterhouse (always in low numbers). In general, microbial contamination was lower in rooms where wrapped rather than unwrapped products were stored. The type of product also affected the degree of contamination, with raw red meat and poultry or dry ingredients giving highest counts, and raw vegetables and cooked products lowest. The work demonstrated that bacteria were present on evaporator cooling coils in all factory cold rooms visited. Although evaporator-cleaning procedures were carried out in some factories as part of routine maintenance these were not shown to be effective at maintaining low levels of bacteria on evaporators. To maintain evaporator hygiene it is suggested that more regular cleaning procedures, possibly by means of automated cleansing systems, should be considered.",

            "abstractNote": "In 2008, Canada experienced one of its most serious outbreaks of foodborne listeriosis. During this outbreak, which was eventually traced back to contaminated deli-meat, there were 57 cases of illness and 23 deaths. As a result of the outbreak, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has developed new Directives for the registered meat and poultry sector. Under the new requirements, production facilities must implement food contact surface testing for Listeria spp. and/or Listeria monocytogenes. The enhanced requirements focus on early detection and control of L. monocytogenes by introducing new testing and reporting requirements for industry, e.g., positive test results from all food contact surface testing must now be immediately reported to the CFIA and companies must perform trend analysis on their test results.In addition, work has begun on updating the current Health Canada policy on L. monocytogenes. The Canadian approach to Listeria control stresses the importance of environmental sampling. In addition to government agencies and food industries working diligently at minimizing the exposure to L. monocytogenes, consumers also have an important role to play in the farm-to-fork continuum. That role calls for Canadians to learn and adopt safe food handling, avoidance of certain high-risk foods, and preparation practices. To this effect, Health Canada has and will continue to undertake the development of science-based consumer education material which will help create an understanding of food safety issues within the context of the public’s right to know about the potential dangers in food, and industry’s responsibility for producing safe food. A combination of all these approaches are currently being adopted and/or developed to improve the control of L. monocytogenes in RTE foods sold in Canada.",

With the aim of verifying the possible interference of the autochthonous microbiota encountered in meat and meat products and processing plants over the presence of Listeria spp., 443 samples, collected from 11 meat retail establishments, were submitted to microbiological analysis to determine the levels of mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms and Escherichia coli and the presence of Listeria spp., according to the methodology proposed by the USDA. The results did not show evident interference of the autochthonous microbiota over Listeria spp., once the genus was detected even in the meat, meat products and environmental samples with high levels of contamination by mesophilic aerobes and coliforms.",

            "abstractNote": "Over the last 10 to 15 years, increasing evidence suggests that persistence of Listeria monocytogenes in food processing plants for years or even decades is an important factor in the transmission of this foodborne pathogen and the root cause of a number of human listeriosis outbreaks. L. monocytogenes persistence in other food-associated environments (e.g., farms and retail establishments) may also contribute to food contamination and transmission of the pathogen to humans. Although L. monocytogenes persistence is typically identified through isolation of a specific molecular subtype from samples collected in a given environment over time, formal (statistical) criteria for identification of persistence are undefined. Environmental factors (e.g., facilities and equipment that are difficult to clean) have been identified as key contributors to persistence; however, the mechanisms are less well understood. Although some researchers have reported that persistent strains possess specific characteristics that may facilitate persistence (e.g., biofilm formation and better adaptation to stress conditions), other researchers have not found significant differences between persistent and nonpersistent strains in the phenotypic characteristics that might facilitate persistence. This review includes a discussion of our current knowledge concerning some key issues associated with the persistence of L. monocytogenes, with special focus on (i) persistence in food processing plants and other food-associated environments, (ii) persistence in the general environment, (iii) phenotypic and genetic characteristics of persistent strains, (iv) niches, and (v) public health and economic implications of persistence. Although the available data clearly indicate that L. monocytogenes persistence at various stages of the food chain contributes to contamination of finished products, continued efforts to quantitatively integrate data on L. monocytogenes persistence (e.g., meta-analysis or quantitative microbial risk assessment) will be needed to advance our understanding of persistence of this pathogen and its economic and public health impacts.",

Strains of Listeria monocytogenes and Listeria innocua tested showed no significant variation as to the extent of injury sustained during storage for 24 h at -9 to -11 degree C. Average 24 h injury ranged from 44-64% for L. monocytogenes strains and 41-54% for L. innocua strains. The most substantial increase in injury was seen in the first 24 h and injury remained constant or increased slightly throughout the 14 day period. Freeze injury was reversible in all Listeria strains tested when trypticase soy broth and Listeria repair broth (LRB) were used as repair media. In order to determine if nonselective pre-enrichment followed by selective enrichment using LRB, resulted in increased detection of Listeria existing naturally in processing environments, samples were obtained from two dairy and one meat processing plant. Use of nonselective pre-enrichment followed by selective enrichment using LRB did not enhance recovery of Listeria from frozen environments. This may be attributed to a limited amount of freeze-injury occurring in a naturally existing population of Listeria.",

            "abstractNote": "Sixteen cheesemaking facilities were sampled during the production season at monthly intervals over a two-year period. Thirteen facilities were found to have samples positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Samples were divided into 4 categories; cheese, raw milk, processing environment and external to the processing environment (samples from the farm such as silage, bedding, and pooled water). In order to attempt to identify the source, persistence and putative transfer routes of contamination with the L. monocytogenes isolates, they were differentiated using PFGE and serotyping. Of the 250 isolates, there were 52 different pulsotypes. No pulsotype was found at more than one facility. Two facilities had persistent pulsotypes that were isolated on sampling occasions at least 6 months apart. Of the samples tested, 6.3% of milk, 13.1% of processing environment and 12.3% of samples external to the processing environment, respectively, were positive for L. monocytogenes. Pulsotypes found in raw milk were also found in the processing environment, however, one of the pulsotypes from raw milk was found in cheese on only one occasion. One of the pulsotypes isolated from the environment external to the processing facility was found on the surface of cheese, however, a number of them were found in the processing environment. The results suggest that the farm environment external to the processing environment may in some cases be the source of processing environment contamination with L. monocytogenes.

This study evaluated contamination patterns of Listeria species at a poultry food production facility, and evaluated the efficacy of procedures to control the contamination and transfer of the bacteria throughout the plant. The presence of Listeria species was studied along the production chain, including raw ingredients, food-contact, non-food-contact surfaces, and finished product. All isolates were sub-typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to identify possible entry points for Listeria species into the production chain, as well as identifying possible transfer routes through the facility. The efficacy of selected in-house sanitizers against a sub-set of the isolates was evaluated. Of the 77 different PFGE-types identified, 10 were found among two or more of the five categories/areas (ingredients, food preparation, cooking and packing, bulk packing, and product), indicating potential transfer routes at the facility. One of the six sanitizers used was identified as unsuitable for control of Listeria species. Combining PFGE data, together with information on isolate location and timeframe, facilitated identification of a persistent Listeria species contamination that had colonized the facility, along with others that were transient.

The purpose of the survey was to determine the frequency and location of certain pathogenic microorganisms in dry milk and whey processing plant environments. A total of 402 samples were collected from 18 plants by each respective plant's personnel. All plants participated on a voluntary basis in response to a request sent to all ADPI members. All 410 samples were tested for Listeria spp., 245 samples were tested for Salmonella, and 312 samples were tested for Yersinia. Of the total, five samples collected from five separate plants were positive for either Salmonella or Listeria. Two samples were positive for Listeria (one for L. monocytogenes), and three samples were positive for Salmonella. None was positive for Yersinia. Four out of the five positive samples were taken from drains in receiving, dryer, and butter production areas of the plants. The fifth positive sample was collected from a prefilter to a dryer.",

The SSWG identified 5 elements required for a complete Listeria control programme (1) Listeria specific Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and sanitation procedures, (2) employee training, (3) environmental microbiological monitoring and testing, (4) raw material controls, and (5) temperature controls for finished product. This manuscript describes specific GMPs and sanitation procedures to minimize Listeria contamination in smoked seafood operations. Targeted procedures that need to be implemented include GMPs to prevent cross contamination caused by improper design and layout of processing operations, the movement of people and equipment in the plant, and inadequate employee hygiene and food handling practices. In addition, cleaning and sanitation procedures for equipment and the processing plant environment that are designed to target Listeria contamination specifically need to be in place.",

Several comments indicated a need for a stronger scientific basis for the proposal to require testing and sanitation of food contact surfaces for Listeria species. In general, the scientific literature indicated that the relationship between the prevalence and level of Listeria species in the plant environment (e.g., food contact and non-food contact surfaces) to the prevalence and level of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) in ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products is not well understood. To better understand this relationship, FSIS requested public input as part of the proposed rule for RTE meat and poultry products (66 FR 12609). In addition to the public request for data, FSIS initiated the planning and development of this risk assessment to: 1) provide insight into the relationship between Listeria species on food contact surface(s) and L. monocytogenes in RTE meat and poultry products; and 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of food contact surface testing and sanitation regimes, pre- and post-packaging interventions, use of growth inhibitors, and combinations of these interventions to mitigate contamination on RTE meat and poultry products and reduce the subsequent risk of illness or death from L. monocytogenes.",

            "abstractNote": "Background. Listeria monocytogenes causes often-fatal infections affecting mainly immunocompromised persons. Sources of hospital-acquired listeriosis outbreaks can be difficult to identify. We investigated a listeriosis outbreak spanning 7 months and involving 5 hospitals.Methods. Outbreak-related cases were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and confirmed by multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA). We conducted patient interviews, medical records reviews, and hospital food source evaluations. Food and environmental specimens were collected at a hospital (hospital A) where 6 patients had been admitted before listeriosis onset; these specimens were tested by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and PFGE. We collected and tested food and environmental samples at the implicated processing facility.Results. Ten outbreak-related patients were immunocompromised by >= 1 underlying conditions or treatments; 5 died. All patients had been admitted to or visited an acute-care hospital during their possible incubation periods. The outbreak strain of L. monocytogenes was isolated from chicken salad and its diced celery ingredient at hospital A, and in 19 of >200 swabs of multiple surfaces and in 8 of 11 diced celery products at the processing plant. PCR testing detected Listeria in only 3 of 10 environmental and food samples from which it was isolated by culturing. The facility was closed, products were recalled, and the outbreak ended.Conclusions. Contaminated diced celery caused a baffling, lengthy outbreak of hospital-acquired listeriosis. PCR testing often failed to detect the pathogen, suggesting its reliability should be further evaluated. Listeriosis risk should be considered in fresh produce selections for immunocompromised patients.",

Aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts and Pseudomonas counts were performed by standard procedures and the prevalence of Listeria, presumptive Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus determined. Statistically significant (P lt 0.05) increases in counts of all types of bacteria were obtained on product samples as a result of processing. Although bacterial counts on neck skin samples decreased by 0.3 to 0.4 log CFU g-1 after spray washing of carcasses, subsequent spinchilling and packaging of whole carcasses resulted in 0.7 to 1.2 log CFU g-1 increases. Bacterial numbers on equipment surfaces, however, decreased significantly from the \"dirty\" to the \"clean\" areas of the abattoir. Transport cages, \"rubber fingers\", defeathering curtains, shackles and conveyor belts repeatedly showed aerobic plate counts in excess of 5.0 log CFU 25 cm-2. Aerobic plate counts of scald tank and spin chiller water were 2 log CFU ml-1 higher than those of potable water samples. Bacterial numbers of the air in the \"dirty\" area were higher than those of the \"clean\" area. Listeria, presumptive Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from 27.6, 51.7 and 24.1% of all product samples, respectively, and Listeria and Staphylococcus aureus were also isolated from selected equipment surfaces.",

            "abstractNote": "Equipment and surfaces in food industries have a highly variable microbial load and they can be a source of Listeria monocytogenes, which is a pathogen capable of forming biofilms increasing the risk of food contamination. In the present study we have evaluated and compared the efficacy of two environmental sampling procedures, the classical cellulose sponge and a novel procedure, the wool fiber mini-roller. First, two stainless steel surfaces and a polyethylene cutting board were inoculated in the laboratory with four strains of L.℗ monocytogenes isolated from meat products. The recovery percentage of L.℗ monocytogenes varied between 0.17% and 5.83%, and the mini-roller showed higher recoveries than the sponge in the stainless steel surfaces, while the sponge performed better in the polyethylene cutting board. The second part of the study was carried out in 26 meat industries where 69 food contact surfaces were sampled for L.℗ monocytogenes, total aerobic mesophiles and Enterobacteriaceae. Overall, 31.9% sampling points tested positive for L.℗ monocytogenes with the sponge as compared to 26.1% that showed positive with the mini-roller. The mean aerobic counts with the sponge (3.76℗ log cfu/cm2) were very similar to those obtained with the mini-roller (3.71℗ log cfu/cm2), and the Enterobacteriaceae counts were somewhat higher with the mini-roller (0.52℗ log cfu/cm2) than with the sponge (0.07℗ log cfu/cm2), but the differences were not significant in either case. Results of this study suggest that the novel mini-roller constitutes a sampling procedure which is convenient to apply on surfaces, is cost-effective, and yields equal recoveries of L.℗ monocytogenes, aerobic mesophiles and Enterobacteriaceae than does the classical sponge, and thus could be used for the monitoring of these microbial groups in food contact surfaces.",

            "abstractNote": "The microbial status in 7 small-scale facilities (SSFs) producing traditional fermented and/or dry sausages was investigated. It was shown that the hygienic status of the processing environment and equipment plays an essential role in the microbial stability and safety of the final products. The current study revealed that the majority of the sampling sites (control points) tested were highly (>4 log CFU/cm(2)) contaminated by spoilage flora (i.e. Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae), with knives, tables and mincing machines being the most heavily contaminated surfaces. Moreover, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in 11.7%, 26.4%, and 11.7% of the food contact surfaces, respectively. The presence of these pathogens seemed to be associated with high numbers of one or more specific groups of the 'house-flora' on the sampling sites of the facilities; however, high numbers of 'house-flora' do not always suggest the presence of pathogens. With regard to product samples, batter samples were heavily contaminated with the 'house-flora' present on surfaces and equipment of the processing facilities while by the end of processing (final products) LAB constituted the predominant microbial flora of all products. The low initial levels of S. aureus and Salmonella found in batter samples as well as the combination of hurdles (mainly a(w)<0.92, average pH ca. <5.0 and competitive effect of natural flora) in the final products were able to inhibit and/or eliminate these pathogens; however, the detection of L. monocytogenes in 3 out of the 7 final products examined is indicative of cross-contamination. Our findings further indicate that inadequate hygiene practices within small-scale-processing facilities may result in loss of microbial control. Therefore, this study addresses the need for strict control measures within SSFs producing traditional fermented sausages.",

            "abstractNote": "During 1998/1999 a total of 36 surveys were carried out in six meat, five seafood and two poultry processing plants. A total of 2522 samples, including processing lines and environment, personnel, raw materials and products (raw or ready-to-eat, RTE), were analysed for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. The environmental and personnel samples were taken after cleaning and after the process had been running for 2 h. Samples of food products were taken after every important step during processing and samples of poultry carcasses were taken immediately after production and after storage for 21 days. The overall incidence of L. monocytogenes in meat processing plants varied from 0% to 15.1%, in poultry plants from 20.6% to 24.1% and in seafood plants from 5.9% to 22.1%. In raw products the average incidence was 15.6% for meat, 22.2% for poultry and 39.0% for seafood products. The heating steps during the production of RTE products eliminated Listeria. On average, 2.3% of RTE meat and 4.8% of RTE seafood products were recontaminated with L. monocytogenes. In the seafood sector almost all Listeria positive samples also included L. monocytogenes (91.1% of the positive samples), whereas in the meat and poultry sectors other Listeria species (mainly L. innocua) dominated. In most plants, the implemented cleaning procedures were insufficient to eliminate Listeria. The results clearly indicated the problematic sites, which in most plants were conveyer belts and other transporting equipment, floors and drains, but also raw material in the meat industry, cutting boards in the poultry industry and cooking equipment in the seafood industry. In order to solve the problems observed in this study, there is a need for close co-operation between the suppliers of equipment and cleaning agents, the staff of cleaning companies and hygiene specialists from the food industry.",

Listeria was detected in 12.5% (78) of the 695 samples (11.2% of the samples were positive for L. monocytogenes), but none of the samples of final product contained Listeria. One hundred seventy-two L. monocytogenes isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Cleavage with macrorestriction enzymes AscI and ApaI yielded 14 different pulsotypes in the plants; two types were dominant, one in each plant. Sixty-three of the 106 isolates in plant A and 43 of the 66 isolates in plant B were of the dominant types. Certain strains, mainly of serotypes 1/2c and 4b and pulsotypes 1A and 2H, were persistent for long periods in both plants. Adaptation of good hygienic practices in the processing plants, including strict rules concerning traffic of staff and equipment, and existing hygienic requirements appeared to be effective in preventing contamination between areas within plants and in the final product. The persistence of Listeria strains in these two processing plants indicates the importance of detecting the places in the processing environment (e.g., transporters, equipment, floors, and drains) where L. monocytogenes can survive so that cleaning and disinfection efforts can be directed to such niches.",

The overall frequencies of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in samples from all sources were 15.1% and 11.3%, respectively, but the incidence of L. monocytogenes in cold-smoked salmon final products was only 4%. A total of 201 L. monocytogenes isolates were characterised by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) in order to trace L. monocytogenes contamination in the processing plants. The combination of AscI and ApaI macrorestriction patterns yielded 24 different pulsotypes ill 6 plants. One pulsotype observed by AscI restriction digestion comprised 148 of the 167 typed isolates from two processing plants. Two other pulsotypes predominated in samples from raw material, processing environments and filial products. The results indicate that raw material, floors, and drains are potential sources of the L. monocytogenes found oil cold-smoked salmon products. This highlights the need to readdress the design and cleaning of processing plants and equipment, and staff behavior.

Experiments were carried out twice within a 20-day period. First, stainless steel coupons were fixed to surfaces adjacent to food contact surfaces, the floor drains and the doormat. They were taken for the analysis of biofilm at three different production stages. Then, biofilm forming bacteria were enumerated and also presence of Listeria monocytogenes was monitored. Biofilm forming isolates were selected on the basis of colony morphology and Gram's reaction; Gram negative cocci and rod, Gram positive cocci and spore forming isolates were identified. Most of the biofilm formations were seen on the conveyor belt of a packaging machine 8 h after the beginning of the production, 6.5 x 10(3) cfu cm(-2). Most of the Gram negative bacteria identified belong to Enterobacteriaceae family such as Proteus, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Shigella, Escherichia, Edwardsiella. The other Gram negative microflora included Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Moraxella, Pseudomonas or Alcaligenes spp. were also isolated. Gram positive microflora of the ice cream plant included Staphyloccus, Bacillus, Listeria and lactic acid bacteria such as Streptococcus, Leuconostoc or Pediococcus spp. The results from this study highlighted the problems of spread of pathogens like Listeria and Shigella and spoilage bacteria. In the development of cleaning and disinfection procedures in ice cream plants, an awareness of these biofilm-forming bacteria is essential for the ice cream plants.",

            "abstractNote": "Large manufacturers of dairy products have implemented comprehensive environmental sampling programs for contamination of their products; however, many small and medium-sized manufacturers are yet to do so in a systematic manner. This study evaluated the results of environmental swabs following detection of Listeria spp. in dairy products over a 4 yr period and the economic impact of monitoring the dairy manufacturing environment to a small, medium and large cheese manufacturer. Listeria spp. were identified in the products of 21 manufacturers on 69 different occasions; in 48% of these (n = 33) the bacterium was confirmed as L. monocytogenes. In all cases the factory underwent extensive cleaning, sanitizing and testing to ensure the processing line was safe for production to resume. Results were then used to assess losses (costs) due to product contamination with L. monocytogenes to a small, medium and large cheese manufacturer with production vol. of 0.2, 2 and 100 t, respectively. Benefits derived from implementing an environmental sampling program are discussed, and pro-active environmental monitoring to provide an economic benefit to the manufacturer is recommended.

This policy was developed using a health risk assessment (HRA) approach and uses as its foundation a combination of inspection, environmental sampling and end-product testing to verify control of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods (RTE food is defined in Appendix A). Focus is given to environmental verification and control, especially in post-lethality areas, as applicable. This policy applies to RTE food sold in Canada, produced both domestically and imported. The present policy revises and replaces the Policy on Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods dated October 4, 2004.",

            "abstractNote": "We have investigated the molecular epidemiology of Listeria monocytogenes from the meat processing industry producing cold cuts and from cases of human listeriosis by discriminative pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A subset of the isolates was also investigated for susceptibility to a disinfectant based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) frequently used in the meat processing industry. The purpose of this investigation was to obtain knowledge of sources, routes of contamination and genetic types of L. monocytogenes present along the production line in the meat processing industry, and to compare meat industry isolates and human isolates. Of the 222 isolates from four meat-processing plants, 200 were from two plants responsible for nearly 50% of the production of cold cuts in the Norwegian market. The strain collection included historical routinely sampled isolates (1989-2002) and isolates systematically sampled through a one year period (November 2001 to November 2002) from fresh meat and production environments in three plants. No isolates were obtained in samples from employees (throat, faeces). Human strains included all available reported isolates from Norwegian patients in selected time periods. The L. monocytogenes PFGE data showed a large genetic heterogeneity, with isolates separated into two genetic lineages and further subdivided into 56 different PFGE profiles. Certain profiles were observed on both sides of production (before and after heat treatment) indicating contamination of end products by fresh meat or fresh meat environments. While fresh meat isolates almost exclusively grouped within lineage I, isolates from end products showed a more balanced distribution between lineages I and II. Ten profiles were common among isolates from human and meat industry. Typing of human isolates identified a previously unrecognised outbreak. Generally, a higher QAC resistance incidence was observed among isolates from the meat processing industry than among human isolates although large plant to plant differences were indicated. No correlation between resistance and PFGE profile or resistance and persistence was observed.",

Soft ripened cheese and underpasteurized milk have been causes of several cases, but recently, ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products have caused hundreds of illnesses and dozens of deaths. Efforts to prevent contamination of meat products with Listeria monocytogenes must be conducted at all levels of production. This is a difficult task given the fact that L. monocytogenes is so widespread in the environment. This booklet is designed to provide guidelines to the small and very small processor on practices and methods to assess, prevent and control the opportunities for contamination of RTE products by L. monocytogenes.",

Environment and final product samples were analyzed and an audit was performed in ten industrial facilities to determine good hygiene and manufacturing practices (GHMP) level of implementation using a checklist. L. monocytogenes frequency was high, being related to industries that obtained high audit scores with a satisfactory level of GHMP implementation. Processing hygiene indicators were associated with L. monocytogenes and related to product handling after processing and to hygiene procedures. Food safety management systems of Portuguese ready-to-eat meat processing industry need enhancement, particularly on preventing post-processing contamination by accurate validation of hygiene procedures, equipment design improvement and staff attitude towards hygiene.

            "abstractNote": "Contamination of dairy products with Listeria monocytogenes is a concern because multiple human listeriosis outbreaks have been linked to contaminated cheese and dairy products. Dairy production on farmstead operations may be a particular concern because L. monocytogenes is also an animal pathogen that can be shed by ruminants with and without clinical symptoms; physical proximity between production animal and dairy processing facilities may thus provide a higher risk for introduction of L. monocytogenes into the dairy production process. To better understand the risks of L. monocytogenes contamination associated with farmstead dairy production, samples from a farmstead dairy processing operation and the milking barn of the directly adjacent dairy sheep operation were tested for L. monocytogenes over a 3-yr period. Prevalence of L. monocytogenes for samples collected on the farm (n = 85) and the dairy production facility (n = 674) was 9.4 and 2.7%, respectively. Molecular subtyping using automated EcoRI ribotyping of L. monocytogenes isolates revealed that distinct subtypes were associated with the dairy production facility and the farm's milking parlor. Although a total of 5 and 4 different ribotypes were identified among isolates obtained from the dairy production facility and the milking parlor, respectively, only 1 ribotype (DUP-1030A) was isolated from both. Different ribotypes were predominant among isolates from the dairy production facility (ribotype DUP-1052A, representing 15 of 18 isolates) and the farm's milking parlor (ribotype DUP-1039A, representing 4 of 8 isolates); each of these ribotypes appeared to persist over time in the respective area. Our data support that i) in farmstead dairy processing facilities, L. monocytogenes present on the farm can largely be prevented from being introduced into the processing facility; and ii) L. monocytogenes can persist on farm and in processing areas, providing a potential high-risk source for contamination. Preventing cross contamination between dairy production and processing facilities and control of persistent L. monocytogenes are thus critical to assuring the microbial safety of farmstead dairy products.",

For detection of L. monocytogenes from raw fish, enrichment was performed in Listeria enrichment broth (LEB), followed by plating on both Oxford agar and LMDS L. monocytogenes plating medium (LMPM). Detection of Listeria and L. monocytogenes from environmental samples was performed using LMDS enrichment medium, followed by plating on both Oxford agar and LMPM. A total of 512 environmental samples and 315 raw fish were taken from two smoked fish processing facilities and screened using these molecular and cultural Listeria detection methods. The BAX for Screening/L. monocytogenes was used to screen raw fish and was 84.8% sensitive and 100% specific. The BAX for Screening/Genus Listeria was evaluated on environmental samples and had 94.7% sensitivity and 97.4% specificity. In conjunction with enrichment in LEB, LMPM had a sensitivity and specificity for detection of L. monocytogenes from raw fish of 97.8 and 100%, respectively. Use of LMDS enrichment medium followed by plating on LMPM allowed for sensitivity and specificity rates of 94.8 and 100%, respectively, for detection of L. monocytogenes from environmental samples. We conclude that both the BAX systems and the use of LMPM allow for reliable and rapid detection of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes. While the BAX systems provide screening results in about 3 days, the use of LMPM allows for L. monocytogenes isolation in 4 to 5 days.",

            "abstractNote": "Reliable data on the sources of Listeria monocytogenes contamination in cold-smoked fish processing are crucial in designing effective intervention strategies. Environmental samples (n = 512) and raw fish samples (n = 315) from two smoked fish processing facilities were screened for L. monocytogenes, and all isolates were subtyped by automated ribotyping to examine the relationship between L. monocytogenes contamination from raw materials and that from environmental sites. Samples were collected over two 8-week periods in early spring and summer. The five types of raw fish tested included lake whitefish, sablefish, farm-raised Norwegian salmon, farm-raised Chilean salmon, and feral (wild-caught) salmon from the U.S. West Coast. One hundred fifteen environmental samples and 46 raw fish samples tested positive for L. monocytogenes. Prevalence values for environmental samples varied significantly (P < 0.0001) between the two plants; plant A had a prevalence value of 43.8% (112 of 256 samples), and plant B had a value of 1.2% (3 of 256 samples). For plant A, 62.5% of drain samples tested positive for L. monocytogenes, compared with 32.3% of samples collected from other environmental sites and 3.1% of samples collected from food contact surfaces. Ribotyping identified 11 subtypes present in the plant environments. Multiple subtypes, including four subtypes not found on any raw fish, were found to persist in plant A throughout the study. Contamination prevalence values for raw fish varied from 3.6% (sablefish) to 29.5% (U.S. West Coast salmon), with an average overall prevalence of 14.6%. Sixteen separate L. monocytogenes subtypes were present on raw fish, including nine that were not found in the plant environment. Our results indicate a disparity between the subtypes found on raw fish and those found in the processing environment. We thus conclude that environmental contamination is largely separate from that of incoming raw materials and includes strains persisting, possibly for years, within the plant. Operational and sanitation procedures appear to have a significant impact on environmental contamination, with both plants having similar prevalence values for raw materials but disparate contamination prevalence values for the environmental sites. We also conclude that regular L. monocytogenes testing of drains, combined with molecular subtyping of the isolates obtained, allows for efficient monitoring of persistent L. monocytogenes contamination in a processing plant.",

Methods and Results: A 3-year assessment of the microbial ecology of four, ready-to-eat food-processing factories was undertaken in which approx. 196 000 and 75 000 product and environmental samples were examined for Escherichia coli and Listeria spp. respectively. A total of 152 E. coli isolates (44 environmental and 108 product in 62 ribogroups) and 260 Listeria spp. isolates (174 environmental and 86 product in 30 ribogroups) were identified and ribotyped. The overall prevalence of E. coli (0.08%), all Listeria spp. (0.35%) and L. monocytogenes (0.23%) was very low. Some 10 E. coli ribogroups and 14 Listeria spp. ribogroups showed evidence for persistence, defined as the isolation of the same strain, from the same site, over a prolonged time period. The majority of E. coli strains were product niche oriented whilst the majority of Listeria spp. strains were environmental niche oriented. Conclusion: Current UK high-risk food factory designs, personnel hygiene and cleaning and disinfection regimes are sufficient to control Listeria spp. and E. coli to very low levels. Significance and Impact of the Study: Persistent strains of these organisms, however, can remain within factory high-risk production areas over considerable time periods, warranting an examination of the strain persistence mechanisms and alternative hygiene controls.",

            "abstractNote": "Use of disinfectants in the UK food industry was assessed. In addition, product and environmental microflora of selected food factories were examined for the persistence of Listeriamonocytogenes and Escherichiacoli, and the disinfectant resistance of any persistent strains was determined. A survey of the use of disinfectants was undertaken in which 40 sites were visited and a further 77 postal questionnaires were returned from farms, and food manufacture, food transport and food retail sites. Quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) were used predominantly, applied in small volumes as a mist. Approx. 30000 samples from the product and environment of 5 chilled food factories were examined for L.monocytogenes and E.coli over a 3-yr period. A total of 181 L.monocytogenes and 176 E.coli isolates were ribotyped to yield 19 and 34 ribogroups, respectively. Some strains were isolated only from the product, a number only from the environment and others from both niches. Some strains were seen to be persistent for the duration of the sampling exercise (2-3 yr). The most comon L.monocytogenes and E.coli strains, together with 2 environmental L.monocytogenes strains, were assessed for resistance to commercial disinfectants as compared with a laboratory L.monocytogenes disinfectant testing strain. Resistance of L.monocytogenes and E.coli strains isolated from the factory were not significantly different from that of the laboratory control strain. It is concluded that persistent strains of L.monocytogenes and E.coli are found in the UK food industry, although this persistence is not related to their increased susceptibility to the most commonly used disinfectants.",

            "abstractNote": "An understanding of Listeria transmission and contamination patterns in processing environments of ready-to-eat foods is critical for improving control of Listeria monocytogenes. A cold-smoked fish processing operation was the site used to study variability in Listeria contamination in a processing environment associated with a ready-to-eat food product throughout one production week (five consecutive days). Intensive testing was conducted on finished products and environmental samples collected at the beginning, middle, and end of each working day. A total of 20 finished products and 22 to 36 environmental samples were collected at each sampling time, and an additional 12 environmental samples were collected on days 4 and 5. Overall, a total of 782 samples, 300 finished products and 482 environmental samples, were tested. All samples were collected from processing steps after smoking, including skinning, trimming, slicing, staging, and packing. A total of 28 finished and 57 environmental samples (9.3 and 11.8%, respectively) were positive for Listeria spp. (including 1 and 5 samples positive for L. monocytogenes, respectively). DNA sequencing of the sigB gene allowed differentiation of eight Listeria subtypes. Listeria prevalence varied significantly between days, and a high prevalence in both environmental samples and finished products on day 3 was likely associated with a point source contamination event by a single Listeria welshimeri subtype. There were no consistent differences in Listeria prevalence among samples collected from the beginning, middle, and end of the production day, but subtype data often revealed unique contamination patterns for samples collected at different times of a given day. Listeria contamination patterns and prevalences were highly variable between days and within a given day. These findings indicate that chance events play an important role in the contamination of finished products, thus complicating efforts to define Listeria transmission patterns in processing environments associated with ready-to-eat foods.",

Listeria spp. were not isolated from raw fish but were a contaminant of processed and partially processed fish. Listeria spp. were also detected on 18.8% of surfaces in contact with fish. Unlike Listeria spp., motile aeromonads were isolated from the raw fish but not from the finished product. They were more frequently isolated from environmental sources than Listeria spp. Y. enterocolitica was not isolated from any of the samples tested. Little evidence was found to show a coincidence of motile aeromonads and Listeria spp., since only one subset of samples showed such a link. It is concluded that contamination by Listeria spp. was from environmental sources at the processing plant at, or beyond, the slicing stage. Reducing the number of wet areas and special cleaning and sanitation considerations for a contained site (the freezer seal) are suggested as ways of reducing contamination of the product.",

An outbreak investigation revealed eight concomitant cases of febrile gastroenteritis caused by L. monocytogenes on the same ward. Median age of the cases was 82 years and median incubation time for listerial gastroenteritis was 21 h (range 9-107). An additional 10 cases of invasive listeriosis caused by the same outbreak strain were identified across the whole country during the summer of 2012. Environmental investigation at the affected municipal hospital ward revealed ready-sliced meat jelly as the suspected source of the infection. During inspection of the meat jelly production plant, one pooled sample taken from a floor drain and a trolley wheel in the food processing environment was positive for the outbreak strain of L. monocytogenes. After the producer stopped the production of meat jelly, no further cases of listeriosis with the outbreak strain were identified via nationwide surveillance.",

            "abstractNote": "One hundred and ten samples of ready-to-eat, vacuum-packed, smoked and cold-salted fish products were collected from retail outlets in southern Finland during 1996 for examination of the occurrence and level of Listeria monocytogenes. The samples originated from 12 producers. Positive samples with levels exceeding 100 CFU/g were encountered mainly in one of the producers (no. 8). Therefore, 200 samples from the plant and the products of this producer were studied during August-September 1996 and May-September 1997, as well as 55 samples from the six fish farms providing raw material fish to this plant, during September 1997-January 1998. The isolates were characterised by serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). L. monocytogenes was isolated in 20% (22/110) of the samples from the retail market, originating from 6 producers. Ten of these positive samples contained L. monocytogenes at > 100 CFU/g (maximum 1.37 X 10(4) CFU/g). Seventeen percent (5/30) of cold-smoked and 50% (16/32) of cold-salted rainbow trout samples were contaminated. Only one hot-smoked fish product (2%) was found to be positive by enrichment. Nineteen (86%) of the strains isolated from the retail samples belonged to serovar 1/2a and three (14%) to serovar 4b. In further studies the production line of plant no. 8 was found to be contaminated. All of isolates from up until autumn, 1997 both the products and the production plant were serovar 1/2a; thereafter one strain of 4b and one of 1/2 (H-antigen untypeable) were isolated from the plant. The samples from raw material fish were all negative for L. monocytogenes. The samples from retail market fell into seven PFGE types. Five and nine PFGE types, respectively, were found from the products and the plant of producer no. 8. PFGE type A was detected from the retail products of four producers and was also dominant among the isolates from production plant no. 8. PFGE type A was the only one found repeatedly from skinning, salting and slicing units as well as from products throughout the whole period. PFGE proved to be a powerful tool for studying contamination points and routes in the production plant. The measures based on hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) program resulted in L. monocytogenes negative samples at production plant no. 8 from the beginning of January 1998.",

            "abstractNote": "Latin-style fresh cheeses, which have been linked to at least 2 human listeriosis outbreaks in the United States, are considered to be high-risk foods for Listeria monocytogenes contamination. We evaluated L. monocytogenes contamination patterns in 3 Latin-style fresh-cheese processing plants to gain a better understanding of L. monocytogenes contamination sources in the manufacture of these cheeses. Over a 6-mo period, 246 environmental samples were collected and analyzed for L. monocytogenes using both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) method and the Biosynth L. monocytogenes detection system (LMDS). Finished cheese samples from the same plants (n = 111) were also analyzed by the FDA method, which was modified to include L. monocytogenes plating medium (LMPM) and the L. monocytogenes confirmatory plating medium (LMCM) used in the LMDS method. Listeria monocytogenes was detected in 6.3% of cheese and 11.0% of environmental samples. Crates, drains, and floor samples showed the highest contamination rates, with 55.6, 30.0, and 20.6% L. monocytogenes positive samples, respectively. Finished products and food contact surfaces were positive in only one plant. The FDA method showed a higher sensitivity than the LMDS method for detection of L. monocytogenes from environmental samples. The addition of LMPM and LMCM media did not further enhance the performance of the FDA method for L. monocytogenes detection from finished products. Molecular subtyping (PCR-based allelic analysis of the virulence genes actA and hly and automated ribotyping) was used to track contamination patterns. Ribotype DUP-1044A, which had previously been linked to a 1998 multistate human listeriosis outbreak in the United States, was the most commonly identified subtype (20/36 isolates) and was isolated from 2 plants. This ribotype was persistent and widespread in one factory, where it was also responsible for the contamination of finished products. We hypothesize that this ribotype may represent a clonal group with a specific ability to persist in food processing environments. While previous listeriosis outbreaks were linked to Latin-style fresh cheeses made from unpasteurized milk, the presence of this organism in pasteurized cheese products illustrates that persistent environmental contamination also represents an important source of finished product contamination.",

Heavy contamination determined by an aerobic plate count of >5.0 log CFU/cm(2) or ml was observed after operation in most of the samples examined, as were samples taken before operation on the interior surfaces of equipment for washing, slicing, dehydrating, and blending, the surfaces of blades for slicing, and the floor surfaces of operation rooms. From these environmental samples, the coliform group was detected before operation. Although 67 strains of 70 coliforms isolated were nonfecal, three Escherichia coli strains were detected in the surface of the operation room floors and the gloves of employees. Bacillus cereus was isolated from 9 of 86 and 17 of 85 samples examined before and after operation with the number of 2.0 to 3.0 log CFU/cm(2) or ml. Listeria spp. were not detected in the environment of the food factories.",

            "abstractNote": "Several virulence factors of Listeria monocytogenes have been identified and extensively characterized at the molecular and cell biologic levels, including the hemolysin (listeriolysin O), two distinct phospholipases, a protein (ActA), several internalins, and others. Their study has yielded an impressive amount of information on the mechanisms employed by this facultative intracellular pathogen to interact with mammalian host cells, escape the host cell's killing mechanisms, and spread from one infected cell to others. In addition, several molecular subtyping tools have been developed to facilitate the detection of different strain types and lineages of the pathogen, including those implicated in common-source outbreaks of the disease. Despite these spectacular gains in knowledge, the virulence of L. monocytogenes as a foodborne pathogen remains poorly understood. The available pathogenesis and subtyping data generally fail to provide adequate insight about the virulence of field isolates and the likelihood that a given strain will cause illness. Possible mechanisms for the apparent prevalence of three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) in human foodborne illness remain unidentified. The propensity of certain strain lineages (epidemic clones) to be implicated in common-source outbreaks and the prevalence of serotype 4b among epidemic-associated stains also remain poorly understood. This review first discusses current progress in understanding the general features of virulence and pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes. Emphasis is then placed on areas of special relevance to the organism's involvement in human foodborne illness, including (i) the relative prevalence of different serotypes and serotype-specific features and genetic markers; (ii) the ability of the organism to respond to environmental stresses of relevance to the food industry (cold, salt, iron depletion, and acid); (iii) the specific features of the major known epidemic-associated lineages; and (iv) the possible reservoirs of the organism in animals and the environment and the pronounced impact of environmental contamination in the food processing facilities. Finally, a discussion is provided on the perceived areas of special need for future research of relevance to food safety, including (i) theoretical modeling studies of niche complexity and contamination in the food processing facilities; (ii) strain databases for comprehensive molecular typing; and (iii) contributions from genomic and proteomic tools, including DNA microarrays for genotyping and expression signatures. Virulence-related genomic and proteomic signatures are expected to emerge from analysis of the genomes at the global level, with the support of adequate epidemiologic data and access to relevant strains.",

Sample sites included the milk processing environment (walls, floors, drains, and steps), processing equipment, raw and pasteurised milk. The FDA listeria-selective enrichment procedure was used to process samples and an additional agar medium, L. monocytogenes Blood Agar (LMBA), was utilized as part of the isolation procedure in order to compare its performance to that of the recommended Oxford and Palcam agars. LMBA proved to be a very useful tool and was able to detect L. monocytogenes from 94.1% of sites compared to the 76.5% and 79.4% detection rate displayed by Oxford and Palcam agars, respectively. The overall incidence of listeria on equipment was 18.8% (6.3% L. monocytogenes), in the environment was 54.7% (40.6% L. monocytogenes) and in raw milk 44.4% (22.2% L. monocytogenes). On one occasion, L. welshimeri was isolated from pasteurised milk, probably demonstrating post-pasteurisation contamination of product. The main environmental sources of L. monocytogenes were considered to be a floor drain and stainless steel steps.",

A total of 319 L. monocytogenes isolates were recovered from raw materials (n = 18), the environment (n = 77), equipment (n = 193), and products (n = 31), and 18 different AFLP types were identified, five of which were repeatedly found to be persistent types. The three compartments (I to III) of the plant showed markedly different contamination statuses. Compartment I, which produced cooked meals, was heavily contaminated with three persistent AFLP types. AFLP type Al dominated, and it comprised 93% of the isolates of the compartment. Compartment II, which produced uncooked chilled food, was contaminated with four persistent and five nonpersistent AFLP types. The equipment of compartment III, which produced cooked ready-to-reheat meals, was free of contamination. In compartments that produced cooked meals, the cleaning routines, product types, and lack of compartmentalization seemed to predispose production lines to persistent contamination. The most contaminated lines harbored L. monocytogenes in coolers, conveyors, and packing machines. Good compartmentalization limited the flow of L. monocytogenes into the postheat-treatment area and prevented the undesired movement of equipment and personnel, thus protecting the production lines from contamination. In compartment II, grated cheese was shown to cause product contamination. Therefore, special attention should be paid to continuous quality control of raw ingredients when uncooked ready-to-eat foods are produced. In compartment II, reconstruction of the production line resulted in reduced prevalence rates of L. monocytogenes and elimination of two persistent AFLP types.",

Therefore, fish farm raising rainbow trout and affiliated slaughterhouse and smoking plants were evaluated for the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes. Samples including raw fish, swabbings of equipment or other surfaces, as well as processing water, salt, fish feed and fish samples taken after various stages of processing were collected from thirty different locations in the plant. For the detection of L. monocytogenes, both conventional and Listeria Rapid Test (LRT) were used. L. monocytogenes was detected in thirty out of sixty samples (50%) by LRT, while it was detected in thirty-four out of sixty samples (57%) by conventional method. No L. monocytogenes was detected from raw fish, smoked fish (before handling) and processing water, but it was detected in all environmental samples including swabbings of equipment or other surfaces and smoked fish samples after filleting.",

A total of 361 environmental samples, focusing on floors and other nonproduct contact surfaces, was taken from all of Vermont's 34 dairy processing plants. The incidence of Listeria monocytogenes (1.4%) was low compared to the incidence of Listeria innocua (16.1%). While only 2.5% yielded other Yersinia spp., 10.5% of the sites were positive for Yersinia enterocolitica. Sites positive for either Listeria or Yersinia were statistically more likely to produce a positive result for both (P < 0.05). Fluid plants had the highest incidence of both Listeria and Yersinia when compared to cheese plants or other types of dairy manufacturing plants. Areas associated with case washers in fluid plants had the highest incidence of microbial contamination. An additional area of concern for all types of plants was sanitizing floor mats and foot baths from which positive microbiological results were obtained. Contamination in wet areas was significantly greater than in dry areas of the plants (P < 0.05). Identification of the sources and conditions associated with these problematic bacterial pathogens is an important step in learning to control their incidence in dairy processing environments.",

It can also be used to produce quantitative data. The method was applied to a processing line which ended in slicing of a product by a manually operated slicing machine. Results demonstrated that, except for a slicer, the incoming raw product and the processing line had little or no contamination. Despite cleaning the slicer more thoroughly than was recommended in the manufacturer's specifications Listeria populations could become established. Using the results the slicer was decontaminated leading to the production a final product which did not contain Listeria spp. The test was applied to 2 other types of processing lines, one ended in slicing of a product by an automated slicer and the other in mixing of a product. Discrete sites of Listeria spp. contamination were identified and decontaminated, and the product was shown to be free of Listeria spp. It is concluded that the method is valuable in the identification of Listeria and L. monocytogenes and confirming effective sanitization of processing environments.",

Samples were collected in the processing environment of the facilities with three different sampling methods (cotton swab, sterile sponge, and composite-ply tissues) to evaluate their ability to recover Listeria spp. A total of 240 samples for each sampling method were collected and tested. The cotton swab method of sampling was significantly (P < 0.01) less efficient in recovery of Listeria spp. than the sterile-sponge and composite-ply tissue methods, which were similar (P > 0.05) in their ability to recover Listeria spp. The specificity and sensitivity of four detection methods (conventional culture, Petrifilm Environmental Listeria Plates [ELP], lateral-flow immunoprecipitation [LFI], and automated PCR) were evaluated for identification of Listeria spp. Facilities were visited until a minimum of 100 positive and 100 negative samples per detection method were collected. The LFI and PCR methods were highly sensitive (95.5 and 99.1%, respectively) and specific (100%) relative to the culture method. The ELP method was significantly less efficient (P < 0.01) than LFI and PCR in detection of Listeria spp., with lower sensitivity (50.6%) and specificity (91.5%). Kappa values indicated excellent agreement of the LFl and PCR assays and moderate agreement of the ELP method to the culture method. Overall, ELP was easy to use but less efficient in detection of Listeria spp. from environmental samples, while the LFI and PCR methods were found to be excellent alternatives to culture, considering performance and time and labor inputs.",

In 2009, we conducted a survey of dairy, fish, and meat facilities under BC authority to estimate the prevalence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods and production environments. From August to October, 250 RTE food samples and 258 swabs from the food processing environments of 43 facilities were collected. Standard culture methods were applied to both food samples and swabs. Of swabs collected from all 258 environmental surfaces, 15% were positive for Listeria spp. Significantly (P < 0.001) more fish facilities than dairy and meat facilities had food contact surfaces contaminated with Listeria spp. L. monocytogenes was found in RTE foods from fish facilities alone (5 of 12); in all five of the fish facilities with contaminated product, one or more environmental swabs were also positive for L. monocytogenes. The results suggest that while control of L. monocytogenes in BC-inspected dairy and meat facilities is effective in limiting food contamination, there is a need for provincial inspectors to initiate improved monitoring and management of contamination by L. monocytogenes in RTE fish processing facilities.",

We further examined 246 of the 259 isolates for adherence phenotype and used PCR to identify those that were Listeria monocytogenes. Adherence was classified as weak, moderate, or strong depending on results obtained with all Listeria isolates by using a fluorescent microplate adherence assay. Among the 246 isolates, there were 61 weakly, 148 moderately, and 37 strongly adherent Listeria, of which 130 (53%) were found to be L. monocytogenes. Plants A and B provided similar recoveries of 39 (7.5%) and 43 (8.3%) Listeria-positive isolates, including 9 (23.1% of Listeria) and 41 (95.3% of Listeria) identified as L. monocytogenes, respectively, that were weakly or moderately adherent. In plant C, we recovered 164 Listeria-positive samples (31.5% isolation rate), which included 80 L. monocytogenes-positive samples (49.8% of Listeria spp.), 52 of which were moderately adherent, as well as all 9 strongly adherent isolates of L. monocytogenes obtained in this study. Adherence properties of Listeria may allow persistence and recurrence in plant environments, potentially increasing the chance of eventual product contamination, and this emphasizes the need for sanitary approaches to prevent colonization by Listeria as well as product antimicrobial interventions should the sanitation barrier be breached.",

Environmental, raw material, and finished product samples were collected weekly during the main processing months (April to June) and tested for Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. Before implementation of control strategies (year 1), the two processing plants showed Listeria spp. prevalences of 29.5% (n = 78) in raw, whole crawfish, 5.2% (n = 155) in the processing plant environment, and 0% (n = 78) in finished products. In year 2, after plant-specific Listeria control strategies were implemented, Listeria spp. prevalence increased in raw crawfish (57.5%, n = 101), in the processing plant environment (10.8%, n = 204), and in the finished product (1.0%, n = 102). Statistical analysis showed a significant increase in Listeria spp. prevalence (P < 0.0001) and a borderline nonsignificant increase in L. monocytogenes prevalence (P = 0.097) on raw material in year 2. Borderline nonsignificant increases were also observed for Listeria spp. prevalence in environmental samples (P = 0.082). Our data showed that Listeria spp. prevalence in raw crawfish can vary significantly among seasons. However, the increased contamination prevalence for raw materials only resulted in a limited Listeria prevalence increase for the processing plant environment with extremely low levels of finished product contamination. Heat treatment of raw materials combined with Listeria control strategies to prevent cross-contamination thus appears to be effective in achieving low levels of finished product contamination, even with Listeria spp. prevalences for raw crawfish of more than 50%.",

            "abstractNote": "Four ready-to-eat smoked fish plants were monitored for 2 years to study Listeria contamination patterns and the impact of plant-specific Listeria control strategies, including employee training and targeted sanitation procedures, on Listeria contamination patterns. Samples from the processing plant environment and from raw and finished product were collected monthly and tested for Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. Before implementation of intervention strategies, 19.2% of raw product samples (n = 276), 8.7% of finished product samples (n = 275), and 26.1% of environmental samples (n = 617) tested positive for Listeria spp. During and after implementation of Listeria control strategies, 19.0% of raw product samples (n = 242), 7.0% of finished product samples (n = 244), and 19.5% of environmental samples (n = 527) were positive for Listeria spp. In one of the four fish plants (plant 4), no environmental samples were positive for L. monocytogenes, and this plant was thus excluded from statistical analyses. Based on data pooled from plants 1, 2, and 3, environmental Listeria spp. prevalence was significantly lower (P < 0.05) for nonfood contact surfaces and the finished product area and for the overall core environmental samples after implementation of control strategies. Listeria prevalence for floor drains was similar before and after implementation of controls (49.6 and 54.2%, respectively). Regression analysis revealed a significant positive relationship (P < 0.05) between L. monocytogenes prevalence in the environment and in finished products before implementation of control strategies; however, this relationship was absolved by implementation of Listeria control strategies. Molecular subtyping (EcoRI ribotyping) revealed that specific L. monocytogenes ribotypes persisted in three processing plants over time. These persistent ribotypes were responsible for all six finished product contamination events detected in plant 1. Ribotype data also indicated that incoming raw material is only rarely a direct source of finished product contamination. While these data indicate that plant-specific Listeria control strategies can reduce cross-contamination and prevalence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in the plant environment, elimination of persistent L. monocytogenes strains remains a considerable challenge.",

            "abstractNote": "Following the 2008 Canadian listeriosis outbreak associated with ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products, regulations on the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in RTE food production facilities were modified by Health Canada, confirming the need to control this pathogen, not only in the final product but also in the plant environment. Information on the occurrence of this microorganism during the early steps of production, such as the slaughtering process and in the cutting area, is scarce in Canada., In this study, we sampled different production steps in a slaughtering and cutting plant in the province of Quebec over a 2-year period. The lairage pens, representative areas of the slaughter line, and cutting zones were targeted after their respective cleaning procedures. A total of 874 samples were analyzed for the presence of L. monocytogenes. Characterization was done by first genoserogrouping the isolates using multiplex PCR and then using a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis approach. L. monocyto genes was detected throughout all production stages. The 108 positive samples found were analyzed further, and we established that there were 4 different serogroups, with serogroup IIb being the most prevalent. The results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed a significant decrease in the diversity of strains from the first areas of the plant to the cutting room (10 pulsotypes in 13 positive samples in lairage and 9 in 86 positive samples in cutting) and also showed the overrepresentation of a single predominant strain in the cutting room environment (type 1, representing 96.1% of the isolates). Biofilm formation analysis of the strains cannot exclusively explain the transitions we observed. A strong genotypic similarity between strains isolated in the early. production areas and some strains in the cutting room was shown. These results support the need for better surveillance of L. monocyto genes prior to RTE food production in order to design control strategies that are better adapted from a public health perspective.",

Within the raw and cooked poultry processing environments, 46% (36 of 79) and 29% (51 of 173) of the samples contained Listeria spp. while 26% (21 of 79) and 15% (27 of 173) contained L. monocytogenes, respectively. Various sites within the processing environment were found to be consistently positive for L. monocytogenes throughout the entire sampling period. Of the raw and cooked products tested, 91% (53 of 58) and 8% (8 of 96) were found to contain Listeria spp. while 59% (34 of 58) and 0% (0 of 96) contained L. monocytogenes, respectively. Although L. monocytogenes was not detected in the cooked products examined, the presence of other Listeria spp. highlights the potential which exists for postprocessing contamination. Multiplex PCR proved to be a convenient and time-saving technique for rapid confirmation of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in a single reaction.",

            "abstractNote": "Although rates of listeriosis are low in comparison to other foodborne pathogenic illness, listeriosis poses a significant risk to human health as the invasive form can have a mortality rate as high as 30%. Food processors, especially those who produce ready-to-eat (RTE) products, need to be vigilant against Listeria monocytogenes, the causative pathogen of listeriosis, and as such, the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in food and in the food processing environment needs to be carefully monitored. To examine the prevalence and patterns of contamination in food processing facilities in Ireland, 48 food processors submitted 8 samples every 2 months from March 2013 to March 2014 to be analyzed for L. monocytogenes. No positive samples were detected at 38% of the processing facilities tested. Isolates found at the remaining 62% of facilities were characterized by serotyping and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). A general L. monocytogenes prevalence of 4.6% was seen in all samples analyzed with similar rates seen in food and environmental samples. Differences in prevalence were seen across different food processors, food sectors, sampling months etc. and PFGE analysis allowed for the examination of contamination patterns and for the identification of several persistent strains. Seven of the food processing facilities tested showed contamination with persistent strains and evidence of bacterial transfer from the processing environment to food (the same pulsotype found in both) was seen in four of the food processing facilities tested.",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis, a relatively rare but life-threatening disease primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the seafood processing industry in the Republic of Ireland. The occurrence of L. monocytogenes was determined by regular sampling of both food samples and processing environment swabs at eight seafood processing facilities over two calendar years. All samples were analyzed by the International Organization for Standardization 11290-1 standard method, and the isolates were characterized by PCR, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, serotyping, and the occurrence of some genes related to survival under stress (SSI-1, Tn6188, and bcrABC). A prevalence of 2.5% in 508 samples (433 environmental swabs and 75 food samples) was found. From the isolates obtained, eight different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles were identified, two occurring in more than one facility and one occurring in food and the environment. Five of the eight pulsotypes identified contained at least one of the three stress survival-related genes tested. The tolerance of the isolates to benzalkonium chloride, a representative quaternary ammonium compound, was also examined and ranged from 5.5 +/- 0.5 to 8.5 +/- 0.5 ppm of benzalkonium chloride. To evaluate the ability of smoked salmon to support the growth of L. monocytogenes, including the T4 widespread pulsotype that was isolated, a challenge test was performed on cold-smoked salmon obtained from two separate producers. The results showed clearly that both types of smoked salmon supported the growth of L. monocytogenes. Although occurrence of L. monocytogenes on seafood was low, this study showed that the smoked salmon used in this study can support the growth of L. monocytogenes; therefore, vigilance is required in the processing facilities to reduce the associated risk.",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria monocytogenes exhibits symbiotic codependence with the dominant commensal bacteria, which may help it avoid being removed or inactivated by disinfectants in local environments. In this study, we investigated L. monocytogenes-positive biofilms at food production facilities, and the dominant bacterial species of the biofilms were identified to determine the properties of the microbiological background. For this purpose, the ISO 11290 method was used for the detection and isolation of L. monocytogenes, and the species were further identified based on 16S rRNA and hly genes. 16S rRNA gene-based cloning, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were combined to evaluate the dominant bacteria of the drain biofilms. Out of 100 drain samples, 8 were naturally contaminated with L. monocytogenes. Three molecular methods consistently showed that Pseudomonas psychrophila, Pseudomonas sp., and Klebsiella oxytoca were dominant species in 3Q, 5Q, and 6Q samples; Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella sp. were significantly dominant in 1-2, 1-3, and 3-2 samples; A. hydrophila and K. oxytoca were dominant in the 2-3 sample; and A. hydrophila and Pseudomonas sp. were prominent in the 3-3 sample. Different biofilms from the same plant shared common bands, suggesting that similar bacteria can be found and can be dominant in different biofilms. This study provides a better understanding of the dominant compositions in these bacterial communities. Further studies to determine the mechanism of co-culture with L. monocytogenes will be of critical importance in predicting effective disinfection strategies.",

The organism was not detected in the pig carcasses prior to processing. Fresh and dry-cured pork did show detectable levels, always ranging below 100CFU per gram. A total of 163 L. monocytogenes isolates collected during one year were characterized by PCR-based serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) restriction analysis. Three predominant PFGE types or pulsotypes seemed to persist in the plant. The pulsotype S1 (serotype group 1/2a, 53% of the isolates) was mostly recovered from whole pieces of meat and environmental sites, while pulsotypes S2 (1/2a, 17%) and S4 (1/2b, 21%) were more frequently associated with ground pork products. The pulsotype S4 was also found in a grinding machine, suggesting a possible association of this machine with the contamination of the ground meat products.",

            "abstractNote": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetically similar or diverse strains of Listeria monocytogenes colonize the environment and carcasses in a single Spanish broiler abattoir over time. The study was composed of 5 surveys over a 1.5-yr period and included the monitoring of cleaning and disinfection procedures. Overall, a total of 212 samples were tested for the presence of L. monocytogenes, and 31% of the samples were found to be positive. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from carcasses and product contact and noncontact sites in the evisceration and carcass classification areas of the abattoir. A total of 132 L. monocytogenes isolates were characterized by PCR-based serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) restriction analysis with the endonucleases ApaI and AscI. Molecular serotyping showed that L. monocytogenes isolates were of serotypes 1/2a and 1/2b. Isolates of serotype 1/2b (89.4%) were contaminating carcasses as well as environmental product contact and noncontact sites, whereas isolates of serotype 1/2a (10.6%) were recovered only from environmental product noncontact sites. A relatively low genetic diversity was found in this group of L. monocytogenes isolates from the abbatoir; only 14 different PFGE types (A1 to A14) were obtained. Nine pulsotypes belonging to serotype 1/2b (lineage I) were grouped in only one PFGE genetic cluster, whereas 5 pulsotypes belonging to serotype 1/2a (lineage II) were grouped into 4 PFGE genetic clusters. Two genetically related pulsotypes of serotype 1/2b (A1 and A2, 64.4% of the isolates) predominated and persisted in the abattoir. Our study indicated that a few strains of L. monocytogenes lineage I that were genetically very closely related might be specifically adapted to colonizing the evisceration zone of the abattoir and were predominant on carcasses over 1 yr. On the other hand, a genetically diverse group of lineage II strains were present in the abattoir environment, but never contaminated carcasses.",

            "abstractNote": "An international group of experts from the food industry, academia, and governments met in Amsterdam in May 2009 to discuss approaches for controlling Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods in anticipation of an agreement by Member States on the Codex Guidelines for the pathogen in foods. The workshop was organised by Ewen Todd (Michigan State University) in cooperation with the European Federation of Food Science and Technology and the Global Harmonization Initiative. The group felt there is a need for a risk-based policy with input from all the stakeholders at local and national levels. An important part of the background is to review the critical factors for control, including the unique growth, survival and virulence characteristics of the pathogen; identifying specific populations at risk; and defining what RTE foods are. They also saw the need for L. monocytogenes food-source attribution through review of outbreak data, implementation of case–control studies, expert elicitations, microbial source tracking, and development of risk assessment models. They also indicated that surveillance of both listeriosis and the gastrointestinal non-invasive form of illness caused by the pathogen are important for public health agencies to establish or enhance; this would require coordination of laboratories through better communication and reporting for the analysis of clinical cases, foods and environmental sources. These laboratories should be also accredited, with some being reference laboratories at national or regional levels. There was consensus agreement on the microbiological criteria as specified in the Codex Guidelines, but it was recognized there were challenges for industry to meet these and government agencies to assess compliance, requiring a robust testing regime for both food and food-contact surfaces at all stages in the production system, as well as for environmental monitoring. Other issues are the development, validation, and acceptance of quantitative methods sufficient to detect the pathogen in food at levels <100CFUg⁻℗£; determining the food’s ability to support the growth of the pathogen or not through challenge studies, and risk assessment models, appropriate labelling of RTE foods, and a standardized approach to tracing and tracking of products throughout the food chain. There is also a need for food worker education and training, and consumer awareness and responsibility. Message mapping is one approach to instill the essential food safety messages regarding listeriosis and the safety of RTE foods for both employees and the public.",

            "abstractNote": "Contamination analysis of persistent and nonpersistent Listeria monocytogenes strains in three meat processing plants and one poultry processing plant were performed in order to identify factors predisposing to or sustaining persistent plant contamination. A total of 596 L. monocytogenes isolates were divided into 47 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types by combining the restriction enzyme patterns of AscI (42 patterns) and ApaI (38 patterns). Persistent and nonpersistent strains were found in all plants. Nonpersistent PFGE types were found mostly at one sampling site, with the processing environment being the most common location, whereas the persistent strains were found at several sampling sites in most cases. The processing machines were frequently contaminated with persistent L. monocytogenes PFGE types, and it was of concern that surfaces having direct contact with the products were contaminated. The role of the processing machines in sustaining contamination and in contaminating the products appeared to be important because the final product of several processing lines was contaminated with the same L. monocytogenes PFGE type as that found in the processing machine. The proportion of persistent PFGE types in heat-treated products was eight times higher than in the raw products, showing the importance of the persistent PFGE types as contaminants of the final heat-treated products. The contamination status of the processing lines and machines appeared to be influenced by the compartmentalization of the processing line, with poor compartmentalization increasing L. monocytogenes contamination. The separation of raw and post-heat treatment areas seemed especially important in the contamination status of post-heat treatment lines.",

Performance is commonly analysed by checking compliance against preset requirements via audits/inspections, or actual food safety (FS) output is analysed by microbiological testing. This paper discusses the usefulness of a concurrent diagnosis of FSMS performance and FS output using new tools; illustrated for three meat-processing companies. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. (food safety indicators), Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae (hygiene indicators), and total viable counts TVC (overall performance) were analysed at ten critical sampling locations covering both product and environmental samples, using the Microbial Assessment Scheme diagnosis. Riskiness of FSMS context and performance of core FSMS activities were assessed using a diagnostic tool (including 51 indicators and corresponding grids with level descriptions). For the (large) beef meat processor, the FS output diagnosis showed too high TVC but the high activity scores of their FSMS indicated that this problem could be only solved by supplier measures. Likewise, for the (medium-size) poultry meat processor, the activity/context diagnosis showed a clear dependency on suppliers. However, the FS output diagnosis revealed a broader contamination problem, and additional measures to improve, amongst others, sanitation program, compliance to procedures, personal hygienic requirements seem necessary. The FS output diagnosis of the (small) lamb meat processor showed various contamination problems (but no pathogens) corresponding with various low activity levels in combination with he high-risk context. The combined diagnosis provided clear directions for improvement to move towards more advanced FSMS activity levels or to reduce riskiness in context.",

            "abstractNote": "The majority of human listeriosis cases appear to be caused by consumption of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods contaminated at the time of consumption with high levels of Listeria monocytogenes. Although strategies to prevent growth of L. monocytogenes in RTE products are critical for reducing the incidence of human listeriosis, control of postprocessing environmental contamination of RTE meat and poultry products is an essential component of a comprehensive L. monocytogenes intervention and control program. Complete elimination of postprocessing L. monocytogenes contamination is challenging because this pathogen is common in various environments outside processing plants and can persist in food processing environments for years. Persistent L. monocytogenes strains in processing plants have been identified as the most common postprocessing contaminants of RTE foods and the cause of multiple listeriosis outbreaks. Identification and elimination of L. monocytogenes strains persisting in processing plants is thus critical for (i) compliance with zero-tolerance regulations for L. monocytogenes in U.S. RTE meat and poultry products and (ii) reduction of the incidence of human listeriosis. The seek-and-destroy process is a systematic approach to finding sites of persistent strains (niches) in food processing plants, with the goal of either eradicating or mitigating effects of these strains. This process has been used effectively to address persistent L. monocytogenes contamination in food processing plants, as supported by peer-reviewed evidence detailed here. Thus, a regulatory environment that encourages aggressive environmental Listeria testing is required to facilitate continued use of this science-based strategy for controlling L. monocytogenes in RTE foods.",

Thus, identification and elimination of sites where L. monocytogenes persists (niches) is critical. Two smoked fish processing plants were used as models to develop and implement environmental sampling plans (i) to identify persistent L. monocytogenes subtypes (EcoRI ribotypes) using two statistical approaches and (ii) to identify and eliminate likely L. monocytogenes niches. The first statistic, a binomial test based on ribotype frequencies, was used to evaluate L. monocytogenes ribotype recurrences relative to reference distributions extracted from a public database; the second statistic, a binomial test based on previous positives, was used to measure ribotype occurrences as a risk factor for subsequent isolation of the same ribotype. Both statistics revealed persistent ribotypes in both plants based on data from the initial 4 months of sampling. The statistic based on ribotype frequencies revealed persistence of particular ribotypes at specific sampling sites. Two adaptive sampling strategies guided plant interventions during the study: sampling multiple times before and during processing and vector swabbing (i. e., sampling of additional sites in different directions [vectors] relative to a given site). Among sites sampled for 12 months, a Poisson model regression revealed borderline significant monthly decreases in L. monocytogenes isolates at both plants (P = 0.026 and 0.076). Our data indicate elimination of an L. monocytogenes niche on a food contact surface; niches on nonfood contact surfaces were not eliminated. Although our data illustrate the challenge of identifying and eliminating L. monocytogenes niches, particularly at nonfood contact sites in small and medium plants, the methods for identification of persistence we describe here should broadly facilitate science-based identification of microbial persistence.",

            "abstractNote": "The Food Safety and Inspection Service’s (FSIS’s) Listeria monocytogenes Risk-based RLm sampling program is designed to detect L. monocytogenes (Lm) contamination from three types of samples: Post-lethality environmentally exposed ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products, RTE food contact surfaces and noncontact environmental sources. The Agency analyzed results of Lm testing of meat and poultry product, food contact surface, and environmental (nonfood contact) samples collected under the RLm sampling program for calendar year 2008. These analyses, which included 6,006 samples from 204 establishments, focused on the following: incidence and categorization of positive Lm samples from sampled establishments; types, sources, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping of Lm isolates from the positive samples; descriptive summaries with respect to Lm control alternatives employed by the establishment, establishment Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) size, establishment production volume, FSIS District, geographic location of the establishment, and season or month of sample collection; and trends in percentage of positive results from April 2006 (program inception) through 2008. For calendar year 2008, 0.5% (5/959) of product samples, 0.6% (19/3,322) of contact surface samples, and 2% (35/1725) of environmental samples tested positive for L. monocytogenes. This included five product samples from four separate establishments. About 1 in 25 establishments had Lm-positive contact surface samples, and about 1 in 6 establishments had Lm-positive environmental samples. The five Lm-positive products were three chicken products, one beef product, and one pork product. Containers, blades, tables, and trays were the chief types of positive contact surface samples. Drains, wheels, floors, floor mats, and squeegees were the most common sources of positive environmental samples; 20% of the tested floor mat samples were positive for Lm. PFGE subtyping results yielded 31 distinct patterns among 59 isolates tested. Matching PFGE subtypes were obtained among multiple isolates from each of six establishments. Results of analysis based on Lm control alternatives showed that the majority of positive samples were obtained from establishments employing Lm control Alternative 2b (antimicrobial treatment/high-risk) and Alternative 3 (sanitation only/highest risk). Most of the positive RLm samples were from establishments that produced deli meats, hot dogs, and cooked products. Positive product and contact surface samples were isolated mainly from establishments that produced between 10,000 and 10,000,000 pounds of product per year. (This encompasses about 85% of all establishments, but less than 15% of total production volumes). Positive environmental samples were obtained at all times of the year, whereas most of the positive contact surface samples were obtained mainly between May and September. Analysis of multi-year (2006-2008) data for the RLm program revealed statistically significant increases for RLMPROD (RLm product) and RLMCONT (RLm food contact surface) samples over time. There also was a downward trend in the percentage of establishments with at least one Lm-positive sample.

            "abstractNote": "A systematic approach in monitoring the hygiene of a meat processing plant using classical microbiological analyses combined with molecular characterization tools may assist in the safety of the final products. This study aimed: (i) to evaluate the total hygiene level and, (ii) to monitor and characterize the occurrence and spread of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in the environment and the final products of a meat industry that processes meat of global origin. In total, 2541 samples from the processing environment, the raw materials, and the final products were collected from a Greek meat industry in the period 2011-2013. All samples were subjected to enumeration of total viable counts (TVC), Escherichia coli (EC) and total coliforms (TCC) and the detection of Salmonella spp., while 709 of these samples were also analyzed for the presence L. monocytogenes. Pathogen isolates were serotyped and further characterized for their antibiotic resistance and subtyped by PFGE. Raw materials were identified as the primary source of contamination, while improper handling might have also favored the proliferation of the initial microbial load. The occurrence of Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes reached 5.5% and 26.9%, respectively. Various (apparent) cross-contamination or persistence trends were deduced based on PFGE analysis results. Salmonella isolates showed wide variation in their innate antibiotic resistance, contrary to L. monocytogenes ones, which were found susceptible to all antibiotics except for cefotaxime. The results emphasize the biodiversity of foodborne pathogens in a meat industry and may be used by meat processors to understand the spread of pathogens in the processing environment, as well as to assist the Food Business Operator (FBO) in establishing effective criteria for selection of raw materials and in improving meat safety and quality. This approach can limit the increase of microbial contamination during the processing steps observed in our study as well as the cross contamination of meat products.",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria monocytogenes is a major concern for the meat processing industry because many listeriosis outbreaks have been linked to meat product consumption. The aim of this study was to elucidate L. monocytogenes diversity and distribution across different Spanish meat processing plants. L. monocytogenes isolates (N = 106) collected from food contact surfaces of meat processing plants and meat products were serotyped and then characterised by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The isolates were serotyped as 1/2a (36.8%), 1/2c (34%), 1/2b (17.9%) and 4b (11.3%). MLST identified ST9 as the most predominant allelic profile (33% of isolates) followed by ST121 (16%), both of which were detected from several processing plants and meat products sampled in different years, suggesting that those STs are highly adapted to the meat processing environment. Food contact surfaces during processing were established as an important source of L. monocytogenes in meat products because the same STs were obtained in isolates recovered from surfaces and products. L. monocytogenes was recovered after cleaning and disinfection procedures in two processing plants, highlighting the importance of thorough cleaning and disinfection procedures. Epidemic clone (EC) marker ECI was identified in 8.5%, ECIII was identified in 2.8%, and ECV was identified in 7.5% of the 106 isolates. Furthermore, a selection of presumably unrelated ST9 isolates was analysed by multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST). Most ST9 isolates had the same virulence type (VT11), confirming the clonal origin of ST9 isolates; however, one ST9 isolate was assigned to a new VT (VT95). Consequently, MLST is a reliable tool for identification of contamination routes and niches in processing plants, and MVLST clearly differentiates EC strains, which both contribute to the improvement of L. monocytogenes control programs in the meat industry.",

Listeria spp. strains yielded a single 938-bp product indicating presence of 16S rRNA conservative sequence typical of the genus, whereas L. monocytogenes strains yielded not only the 938-bp product but also a 750-bp product - a result of amplification within region of the listeriolysin (hly A) gene. The assay was used to verify identification of 50 colonies performed using classical tests, including catalase and hemolytic activity, motility and API(R)LISTERIA (bioMerieux) biochemical tests. Among isolates, 4 strains (8%) were found characterised by contradictory results of biochemical and genetic tests. The possibility of simultaneous identification and differentiation of potentially pathogenic L. monocytogenes strains from other Listeria spp. during one reaction performed was proved.",

A total of 230 samples were collected and 40 L. monocytogenes isolates were obtained and subjected to serotyping and investigated for the presence of ten virulence-associated genes using multiplex PCR assays. The isolates were further subjected to PFGE and investigated for their adhesion abilities in polystyrene microtiter plates. L. monocytogenes was found in 6% of food contact surfaces, in sausages at the end of acidification (3%) and ripening (8%). Serotyping revealed the presence of four serovars: 1/2c (37.5%), 1/2b (27.5%), 4b (22.5%) and 1/2a (12.5%). All virulence-associated genes were detected in 67.5% of the isolates. Isolates from processing environment, semi-processed and finished products showed high pulsotype diversity and the majority of isolates presented weak adhesion capability. The detection of the pathogen in fermented sausages confirms the ability of L. monocytogenes to overcome the hurdles of the manufacturing process.",

Another objective was evaluation of the different hygiene-monitoring methods. Total aerobic heterotrophic and enterobacteria, yeast and mold samples were collected and ATP levels measured in 28 factories. The number of well or adequately washed and disinfected factories was small (2 of 28), in terms of total aerobic heterotrophic bacterial counts on the surfaces. Most surfaces contaminated with bacteria were heavily contaminated. Results of the ATP and the total bacteria contact agar slide methods were poorly correlated (r = 0.21) although 68% of the samples were categorized as good to moderate or unacceptable with both methods. The Listeria-positive surface samples usually contained increased numbers of total bacteria (70.9%). The contamination of products and raw fish together with Listeria spp. was 45% and with Listeria monocytogenes 12%. Cold smoked fish was the most contaminated, with 75% Listeria spp. and cold salted fish with 20% L. monocytogenes. Listeria innocua was found in the samples more than twice as often as L. monocytogenes.",

Sampling started in the slaughtering process and finished with raw broiler meat or ready-to-eat cooked product. Sampling sites positive for L. monocytogenes at the broiler abattoir were the air chiller, the skin-removing machine and the conveyor belt leading to the packaging area. The L. monocytogenes contamination rate varied from 1 to 19% between the two plants studied. Furthermore, 62% (38 of 61) of the raw broiler pieces, bought from retail stores, were positive for L. monocytogenes. Altogether, 136 L. monocytogenes isolates were obtained for serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) characterization performed with two rare-cutting enzymes (ApaI and AscI). Altogether three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2c and 4b) and 14 different PFGE types were obtained using information provided from both ApaI and AscI patterns for discrimination basis. The two broiler abattoirs studied did not share the same PFGE types. However, the same PFGE types found in the raw broiler pieces at the retail level were also found in the broiler abattoirs where the broilers had been slaughtered.",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria monocytogenes is ubiquitous in nature and a major concern for the food industry, since it is the causal agent of the serious foodborne illness listeriosis. This organism can be introduced through many routes to foodprocessing environments and may become established on food-processing equipment. Subsequently, food products may become contaminated during processing. In addition, the bacterium can grow at refrigeration temperatures. Biofilms are regarded as important with respect to the survival and growth of microorganisms in the food industry. Microorganisms growing in biofilms are protected against cleaning and disinfection and are difficult to eradicate. Listeria monocytogenes may grow in biofilms that protect them against environmental stress and can be isolated from surfaces after cleaning and disinfection. For each individual food-processing plant, a limited number of clones of L. monocytogenes may become established and persist for years. Persistent strains adhere to surfaces and form biofilms more readily compared to sporadically found strains, suggesting that adherence to surfaces is important for survival and persistence of L. monocytogenes in foodprocessing environments. Listeria monocytogenes can adhere to all the materials commonly used in the food industry. In biofilms L. monocytogenes is significantly more resistant to disinfection than its free-living counterparts and thick, complex biofilms are more difficult to remove than adherent single cells of L. monocytogenes. Several novel approaches to avoid adhesion of L. monocytogenes have been proposed, but high costs, practical difficulties or resistance problems limit their practical use. Despite considerable research on the adhesive properties and resistance of L. monocytogenes enabling its survival in the food production environment, a final solution for avoiding establishment of the bacterium has not yet been found.",

            "abstractNote": "The quantitative and qualitative patterns of environmental contamination by Listeria monocytogenes were investigated in the production chain of dry-cured Parma ham. Standard arrays of surfaces were sampled in processing facilities during a single visit per plant in the three compartments of the food chain, i.e., ham production (19 plants) and postproduction, which was divided into deboning (43 plants) and slicing (25 plants) steps. The numbers of sampled surfaces were 384 in ham production, with 25 positive for L. monocytogenes, and 1,084 in postproduction, with 83 positives. Statistical analysis of the prevalence of contaminated surfaces showed that in ham production, contamination was higher at the beginning of processing and declined significantly toward the end, while in postproduction, prevalence rose toward the end of processing. Prevalence was higher in the deboning facilities than in slicing facilities and was dependent on the type of surface (floor/drainage > clothing > equipment). The qualitative pattern of contamination was investigated through an analysis of the survey isolates and a set of isolates derived from routine monitoring, including longitudinal isolations. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed a remarkable clonality of L. monocytogenes within plants, with the detection of 16 plant-specific clones out of 17 establishments with multiple isolates. Repeated detections of clonal isolates >6 months apart were also observed. Six was the maximum number of between-isolate differences in core SNPs observed within these clones. Based on the same six-SNP threshold, three clusters of clonal isolates, shared by six establishments, were also identified. The spread of L. monocytogenes within and between plants, as indicated by its clonal behavior, is a matter of concern for the hygienic management of establishments.",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria monocytogenes enters the food processing facility via environment, or contaminated raw materials. To increase the understanding of L. monocytogenes environmental contamination in the meat and dairy food sector, six European scientific institutions sampled twelve food processing environments (FPEs) in a harmonized methodological approach. The selection of six previously assumed uncontaminated (UC) FPEs and six contaminated (C) FPEs was based on the L. monocytogenes occurrence information originating from the time prior to the current study. An aim of the study was to highlight, that FPEs regarded for years as uncontaminated, may also become L. monocytogenes contaminated and repeated environmental sampling could help to identify the potential sources of contamination.From a total of 2242 FPE samples, L. monocytogenes was present in 32% and 8.8% of meat and dairy processing environments, respectively. In the actual study, each FPE was contaminated with L. monocytogenes on at least one sampling occasion. Three contamination scenarios could be observed: (i) sporadic contamination in the interface of raw material reception and hygienic areas, (ii) hotspot contamination in the hygienic processing areas (iii), and widely disseminated contamination in the entirely FPE. These data demonstrate that L monocytogenes are common colonizers of FPEs in the European processing facilities sampled and that a consistent cross-contamination risk exists. To avoid food contamination, a risk assessment approach should assign risk levels to critical control areas (CCAs) and identify those where cross-contamination should be essentially excluded.

            "abstractNote": "A longitudinal study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Listeria spp. in a. commercial fresh mushroom slicing and packaging environment. Samples were collected at three different sampling periods within a 13-month time interval. Of the 255 environmental samples collected, 18.8% tested positive for L. monocytogenes, 4.3% for L. innocua, and 2.0% for L. grayi. L. monocytogenes was most often found on wet floors within the washing and slicing and packaging areas. Each of the 171 L. monocyto genes isolates found in the environment could be placed into one of three different serotypes; 1/2c was predominant (93.6%), followed by 1/2b (3.5%) and 1/2a (2.9%). Of 58 isolates subtyped using multi-virulence-locus sequence typing, all 1/2c isolates were identified as virulence type (VT) 11 (VT11), all 1/2b isolates were VT105, and 1/2a isolates were either VT107 or VT56. VT11 was designated as the predominant and persistent clone in the environment because it was isolated repeatedly at numerous locations throughout the study. The overall predominance and persistence of VT11 indicates that it likely colonized the mushroom processing environment. Areas adjacent to the trench drain in the washing and slicing area and a floor crack in the packaging area may represent primary harborage sites (reservoirs) for VT11. Improvements made to sanitation procedures by company management after period 2 coincided with a significant (P <= 0.001) reduction in the prevalence of L. monocytogenes from 17.8% in period 1 and 30.7% in period 2 to 8.5% in period 3. This suggests that targeted cleaning and sanitizing procedures can be effective in minimizing the occurrence of L. monocyto genes contamination in processing facilities. Additional research is needed to understand why VT11 was predominant and persistent in the mushroom processing environment.",

A total of 59 finished products were examined throughout this study. L. monocytogenes was isolated from four of these samples during summer and autumn but was not found during winter or spring. During the warmer seasons, L. monocytogenes was more prevalent on processing equipment, especially slicing machines (8 of 54 samples in summer and autumn versus 1 of 50 samples in winter and spring). L. monocytogenes was not detected on whole skins removed from 23 frozen raw fish.

Sampling of food contact surfaces, non-food contact surfaces, and liquids such as drain effluents are addressed. Sponge stick swabs are considered advantageous for surface sampling and tips regarding their application are given. Liquids are collected using sterile dippers and the procedure for their correct use is described. Advice on places to sample, the best time for sampling and the frequency of sampling are also given. Such details help hygienists/microbiologists to be successful in their attempts to isolate strains of Listeria, even if such bacteria are well attached to surfaces or located in niches that are difficult to reach.",

            "abstractNote": "We have applied molecular approaches, including PCR-based detection strategies and DNA fingerprinting methods, to study the ecology of Listeria monocytogenes in food processing environments. A total of 531 samples, including raw fish, fish during the cold-smoking process, finished product, and environmental samples, were collected from three smoked fish processing facilities during five visits to each facility. A total of 95 (17.9%) of the samples tested positive for L. monocytogenes using a commercial PCR system (BAX for Screening/Listeria monocytogenes), including 57 (27.7%) environmental samples (n = 206), 8 (7.8%) raw material samples (n = 102), 23 (18.1%) samples from fish in various stages of processing (n = 127), and 7 (7.3%) finished product samples (n = 96). L. monocytogenes was isolated from 85 samples (16.0%) using culture methods. Used in conjunction with a 48-h enrichment in Listeria Enrichment Broth, the PCR system had a sensitivity of 91.8% and a specificity of 96.2%. To track the origin and spread of L. monocytogenes, isolates were fingerprinted by automated ribotyping. Fifteen different ribotypes were identified among 85 isolates tested. Ribotyping data established possible contamination patterns, implicating raw materials and the processing environment as potential sources of finished product contamination. Analysis of the distribution of ribotypes revealed that each processing facility had a unique contamination pattern and that specific ribotypes persisted in the environments of two facilities over time (P less than or equal to 0.0006). We conclude that application of molecular approaches can provide critical information on the ecology of different L. monocytogenes strains in food processing environments. This information can be used to develop practical recommendations for improved control of this important food-borne pathogen in the food industry.",

            "abstractNote": "The cold-smoked fish industry was used as a model for the development of a system for monitoring Listeria spp. in foods and in the food processing environment. A total of 214 samples including raw fish, fish during the cold-smoking process, finished product, and environmental samples were collected from three processing facilities over two visits to each facility. Samples were screened for Listeria spp. using the BAX for Screening/genus Listeria polymerase chain reaction system (PCR) and by culture. Listeria spp., confirmed by the API Listeria test strip or by a PCR assay targeting the L. monocytogenes hlyA gene, were isolated from a total of 89 (41.6%) samples. Of these, 80 samples also tested positive for Listeria spp. using the BAX system. Specifically, 42 (55.3%) environmental samples (n = 76), 11 (25.6%) raw materials samples (n = 43), 20 (35.1%) samples from fish in various stages of processing (n = 57), and 7 (18.4%) finished product samples (n = 38) tested positive for Listeria spp. using the BAX system. Five (4.0%) of the 125 culture-negative samples yielded BAX system-positive results. Listeria isolates from each of nine culture-positive/BAX system-negative samples yielded a positive reaction when tested in pure culture by the BAX system, suggesting that our false-negative results were likely due to the presence of low Listeria numbers in the initial enrichment as opposed to nonreacting isolates. The employment of alternative enrichment protocols, such as the two-step enrichment recommended by the manufacturer, may increase the sensitivity of the assay.",

During processing in the plant the prevalence of L. monocytogenes ranged from 25.9 to 41.4%. Cleaning and disinfection decreased the prevalence to 6.4%. Isolates of L. monocytogenes were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using restriction endonuclease ApaI. Identical DNA types were obtained from turkey products and the processing line even after cleaning and disinfection. Two identical DNA types were demonstrated among isolates from turkey products and human cases of listeriosis. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes in turkey products ranged from 7.3 to 17.4% for ready-to-eat products and raw products, respectively. Since none of the 27 flocks examined before slaughter sampled positive for L. monocytogenes and the prevalence increased during processing, the potential risk from turkey meat was apparently due to factory hygiene rather than intrinsic contamination of the turkeys.",

Molecular subtypes of L. monocytogenes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) restriction analysis. A total of 541 L. monocytogenes isolates were recovered from the environment and equipment (n=165), carcasses (n=28), raw products (n=321), and dry-cured products (n=27). Only 29 different PFGE types were identified, 3 of which were repeatedly found to be persistent types and accounted for 73% of the isolates. One PFGE type dominated (45% of the isolates) and was mostly recovered from intermediate manufactured products and the environment of the manufacturing area. L. monocytogenes persistence appeared strongly linked to the manufacture of products and not to its sustained entrance with the raw material. Some clones were found to survive in the manufacturing area for 3 years. Controlling the contamination of raw ingredients, improving the compartmentalization, and changing the cleaning protocols resulted in reduced prevalence rates of L. monocytogenes on products; two persistent PFGE types were eliminated from the processing plant, although eradication of other adapted strains has not been achieved.",

            "abstractNote": "The aim of this study was to investigate the basis of the putative persistence of Listeria monocytogenes in a new industrial facility dedicated to the processing of ready-to-eat (RTE) Iberian pork products. Quaternary ammonium compounds, which included benzalkonium chloride (BAC), were repeatedly used as surface disinfectants in the processing plant. Clean and disinfected surfaces were sampled to evaluate if resistance to disinfectants was associated with persistence. Of the 14 isolates obtained from product contact and non-product contact surfaces, only five different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types were identified during the 27-month study period. Two of these PFGE types (S1 and S10-1) were previously identified to be persistent and BAC-resistant (BAC(r)) strains in a geographically separate slaughterhouse belonging to the same company. The remaining three PFGE types, which were first identified in this study, were also BAC(r). Whole-genome sequencing and in silico multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of five BAC(r) isolates of the different PFGE types identified in this study showed that the isolate of the S1 PFGE type belonged to MLST sequence type 31 (ST31), a low-virulence type characterized by mutations in the inlA and prfA genes. The isolates of the remaining four PFGE types were found to belong to MLST ST121, a persistent type that has been isolated in several countries. The ST121 strains contained the BAC resistance transposon Tn6188. The disinfection-resistant L. monocytogenes population in this RTE pork product plant comprised two distinct genotypes with different multidrug resistance phenotypes. This work offers insight into the L. monocytogenes subtypes associated with persistence in food processing environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Seven blue crab processing plants were sampled to determine the prevalence and sources of Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes for two years (2006-2007). A total of 488 raw crabs, 624 cooked crab meat (crab meat) and 624 environmental samples were tested by standard methods. Presumptive Listeria spp. were isolated from 19.5% of raw crabs, 10.8% of crab meat, and 69.5% of environmental samples. L. monocytogenes was isolated from 4.5% of raw crabs, 0.2% of crab meat, and 2.1% of environmental samples. Ninety-seven percent of the isolates were resistant to at least one of the ten antibiotics tested. Eight different serotypes were found among 76 L monocytogenes isolates tested with the most common being 4b, 1/2b and 1/2a. Automated EcoRI ribotyping differentiated 11 ribotypes among the 106 L. monocytogenes isolates. Based on ribotyping analysis, the distribution of the ribotypes in each processing plant had a unique contamination pattern. A total of 92 Apal and 88 Ascl pulsotypes among the 106 L monocytogenes isolates were found and distinct pulsotypes were observed in raw crab, crab meat and environmental samples. Ribotypes and serotypes recovered from crab processing plants included subtypes that have been associated with listeriosis cases in other food outbreaks. Our findings suggest that molecular methods may provide critical information about sources of L. monocytogenes in crab processing plants and will augment efforts to improve food safety control strategies such as targeting specific sources of contamination and use of aggressive detergents prior to sanitizing.

Raw crabs, crabmeat, and environmental sponge samples were collected monthly from se ten processing plants during the plant operating season, May through November 2006. For detection of L. monocytogenes in raw crabs and crabmeat, enrichment was performed in Listeria enrichment broth, whereas for environmental samples, demi-Fraser broth was used, and then plating on both Oxford agar and L. monocytogenes plating medium was done. Enriched samples were also analyzed by BAX PCR. A total of 960 samples were examined; 59 were positive by BAX PCR and 43 by SCM. Overall, there was no significant difference (P <= 0.05) between the methods for detecting the presence of L. monocytogenes in samples collected from crab processing plants. Twenty-two and 18 raw crab samples were positive for L. monocytogenes by SCM and BAX PCR, respectively. Twenty and 32 environmental samples were positive for L. monocytogenes by SCM and BAX PCR, respectively, whereas only one and nine finished products were positive. The sensitivities of BAX PCR for detecting L. monocyto genes in raw crabs, crabmeat, and environmental samples were 59.1, 100, and 60%, respectively. The results of this study indicate that BAX PCR is as sensitive as SCM for detecting L. monocytogenes in crabmeat, but more sensitive than SCM for detecting this bacterium in raw crabs and environmental samples.",

Prevalence of L. monocytogenes was 46% in frozen vegetables and 41.3% in swab samples taken from the plant environment. Survival studies using artificial inocula demonstrated that the number of Listeria in frozen produce stored for 100 days did not significantly decrease in relation to the initial contamination level. A subset of 129 L. monocytogenes isolates originating from produce and the plant environment were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Seventy-six of these isolates were retyped by ribo- and serotyping. Thirteen pulsotypes and 18 ribotypes were distinguished. Persistent Listeria isolates were found even when cleansing and sanitization was applied on a daily basis. Nine (69.2%) of",

            "abstractNote": "AIMS: The prevalence, level of contamination and epidemiological profile of Listeria monocytogenes were investigated in two meat-producing plants during a 20-month period. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sampling for L. monocytogenes was carried out in a cattle slaughterhouse (n = 72) and a swine meat-processing plant (n = 68) during a 20-month period. Swabs and food samples were analysed with the most probable number (MPN) technique for L. monocytogenes and the isolated strains were characterized by AscI-restriction analysis pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (REA-PFGE). Contamination of meat and meat products was always at low level (below 50 MPN per gram). The seven L. monocytogenes positive samples isolated in the bovine slaughterhouse yielded strains with the same REA-PFGE profile. However, the seven strains isolated in the swine meat processing plant showed six different profiles. Two of them showed indistinguishable profiles with L. monocytogenes strains collected from other meat processing facilities located in the same area. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The genotyping method is a valuable tool to investigate contamination sources. The study of REA-PFGE profiles indicated that environmental contamination was probably responsible for the persistence of over 16 months of one strain of L. monocytogenes in the cattle slaughterhouse. Several meat suppliers could be responsible for the contamination in the pig meat processing facility, and this is confirmed by the finding of some identical strain in other meat processing facilities located in the same area.",

            "abstractNote": "Potential sources of contamination of fresh sauces by Listeriamonocytogenes and persistence of genotypes within the processing environment were investigated. 23 L.monocytogenes strains were isolated from sauces (pesto, nut, salmon and truffle), their raw materials, processing equipment and the processing environment at 2 processing plants (A and B), and characterized by molecular typing with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), serotyping and mouse bioassay. Results showed thatL.monocytogenes was detected in equipment (a volumetric doser) and in samples of all sauces, but not in raw materials or environmental samples in plant A. In plant B, L.monocytogenes was isolated from pesto and nut sauces, and samples of 1 of the raw materials (pine seeds), but not equipment or environmental samples. Serotyping revealed that strains found in both plants were serotypes 1 (21 strains) and 4 (2 strains). All strains tested positive for pathogenicity by the mouse bioassay. Digestion of genomic DNA of the 23 strains with ApaI and AscI produced 3 PFGE types; plant A strains were all restriction profile 1, while those of plant B belonged to profiles 2 and 3. It was deduced that the source of contamination in plant A was the equipment since L.monocytogenes was present only in the volumetric doser and end products. In plant B, since no environmental or equipment samples were positive, the source of contamination was asssumed to be the plant personnel. Persistence of 2 clones in plant B over a 17-month period suggested an endemic occurrence of L.monocytogenes. It is proposed that the highly discriminatory PFGE molecular typing technique be used by health authorities and food processors to control food safety.",

A total of 378 sponge samples obtained from 21 dairy plants were analyzed for Listeria using three different enrichment media. Use of extended microbiological analysis allowed us to identify 26 Listeria positive sites which would have not been identified had a single test format been employed. Eighty (80) of 378 sites (21.2%) were identified as Listeria positive. Listeria innocua was isolated from 59 of the 80 (73.8%) positive samples, L. monocytogenes was identified in 35 (43.8%) of the positive samples, and L. seeligeri was isolated from 5 (6.3%) of the Listeria positive samples. Positive equipment samples were obtained from 6 of the 21 (28.6%) plants and 19 of the 21 (90.5%) plants had positive environmental sites. Seventeen of the 215 (7.9%) samples from equipment were positive for Listeria species. Eleven of these sites, including 3 holding tanks, 2 table tops, 3 conveyor/chain systems, a pasta filata wheel, a pint milk filler and a brine pre-filter machine, were positive for L. monocytogenes. Nineteen of the 21 (90.5%) plants had positive environmental sites. Sixty-three of the 163 (41.1%) samples from environmental sites were Listeria positive and 24 were positive for L. monocytogenes. Two-tailed student t-test analysis of the mean frequencies indicated that the level of contamination was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in 'environmental' (49.7%) as opposed to 'equipment' samples (7.0%). Our study indicates that environmental contamination with Listeria does not necessarily translate into contamination of equipment within the same plant, and that greater emphasis needs to be placed on the cleaning and sanitizing of the plant environment.",

Two different primary enrichment media–University of Vermont Modified Listeria Enrichment Broth and Listeria Repair Broth–were employed to increase the probability of identifying positive samples. Samples were also tested using both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based (ELlSA-based) assay and a gene probe assay. A total of 346 sponge samples were evaluated for the presence of Listeria. Listeria spp. were identified via one or more of the assays 122 (35.3%) times. Fifty-five of the positive samples (37.2%) contained Listeria monocytogenes and 93 (62.8%) contained Listeria innocua. Of the 30 plants tested, 9 had a dairy farm contiguous to the processing facilities. Our results show that these plants are more likely to be contaminated (9/9) than those plants without on site dairy farms (17/21). Analysis of the Listeria spp. results indicated that contamination was significantly higher (a = 0.1) at those plants with an on-site dairy farm (x = 50.1%) than those plants without an on-site dairy tarm (x = 33.5%. Plants producing dairy ingredients, frozen milk products or tluid milk were all shown to have significantly higher incidence rates than expected. Conversely, plants producing cultured dairy foods. or a combination of cultured dairy foods and fluid milk were found to have significantly lower incidence rates than expected. There was no statistically significant difference in contamination by area within the plants.",

The prevalence of E. coli O157: H7 (68.1 versus 55.9%) and Salmonella (91.8 versus 50.3%) was higher (P < 0.05), and the prevalence of Listeria spp. (37.7 versus 75.5%) and L. monocytogenes (0.8 versus 18.7%) was lower (P < 0.05) for the hides of cattle slaughtered at plant A versus plant B. Similarly, the prevalence of Salmonella (52.0 versus 25.3%) was higher (P < 0.05) and the prevalence of Listeria spp. (12.0 versus 40.0%) and L. monocytogenes (1.3 versus 14.7%) was lower (P < 0.05) for the fence panels of the holding pens of plant A versus plant B. The prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 (3.1 versus 10.9%), Listeria spp. (4.5 versus 14.6%), and L. monocytogenes (0.0 versus 1.1%) was lower (P < 0.05) for preevisceration carcasses sampled at plant A versus plant B. Salmonella (both plants), Listeria spp. (plant B), and L. monocytogenes (plant B) were detected on fabrication floor conveyor belts (product contact surfaces) late during the production day. For plant B, 21 of 148 (14.2%) late-operational fabrication floor conveyor belt samples were L. monocytogenes positive. For plant B, E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes were detected in preoperational fabrication floor conveyor belt samples. Overall results suggest that there are regional differences in the prevalence of pathogens on the hides of cattle presented for harvest at commercial beef processing plants. While hide data may reflect the regional prevalence, the carcass data is indicative of differences in harvest practices and procedures in these plants.",

            "abstractNote": "Human listeriosis, caused by Listeria monocytogenes, is a severe bacterial infection that can lead to meningitis, cerebromeningitis, bacteremia or septicemia, with acute lethality and potentially leading to death. A study has shown that 29.5% of the caged laying hens in France are contaminated by L. monocytogenes (Chemaly et al., 2008). However, very little information regarding egg and egg product contamination is currently available. The objective of this study is to determine the sanitary status of egg products and egg breaking plants in France regarding Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes contaminations. The sampling scheme performed in five egg breaking plants in Western France during one year have revealed that 8.5% of raw egg products were contaminated by L. monocytogenes. No pasteurized egg products have been shown to be contaminated by L. monocytogenes. However, a high level of contamination by Listeria spp., and particularly by L. innocua, has been shown with 26.2% and 1.8% of raw and pasteurized egg products contaminated, respectively. This work has also revealed the presence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in the environment of egg breaking plants with 65.1% and 8.0% of contaminated samples, respectively. The typing of 253 isolates of L. monocytogenes by PFGE using ApaI and AscI enzymes has revealed a high diversity with 46 different pulsotypes and has shown that the raw material is a source of contamination of egg breaking plants. One L. monocytogenes cluster was dominant in the 5 egg-breaking plants during the four seasons studied. The issue of which strains are better adapted to egg products must be considered and studied in depth by comparing them to pulsotypes from strains of other chains. However, the traceability of L. monocytogenes in plants during the various seasons has also made it possible to highlight the presence of strains that are specific to egg breaking plants. The study of cleaning and disinfection methods in these plants as well as the recurring bacteria's resistance to disinfectants could provide answers to the egg product industry.",

L. monocytogenes was most often detected in samples from the smokehouse, where 29% of the environmental and 26% of the fish samples during processing contained the bacteria. 17% of the fish raw material to the smokehouse were contaminated, while 11% of the samples from vacuum-packed smoked salmon were positive for L. monocytogenes. The slaughterhouse was sporadically contaminated, but L. monocytogenes was not found in 50 samples of slaughtered fish. L. monocytogenes was found in the seawater outside the slaughterhouse. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis divided the isolated L. monocytogenes strains into 11 electrophoretic types (ETs). One ET, ET-6, which is the most common ET in Norway, seemed to have colonized the smokehouse. Isolates from the seawater, from the slaughterhouse and from fish coming into the smokehouse, before filleting, were other ETs.",

            "abstractNote": "The aim of this study was to analyze the changing patterns of Listeria monocytogenes contamination in a cheese processing facility manufacturing a wide range of ready-to-eat products. Characterization of L. monocytogenes isolates included genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MIST). Disinfectant-susceptibility tests and the assessment of L. monocytogenes survival in fresh cheese were also conducted. During the sampling period between 2010 and 2013, a total of 1284 environmental samples were investigated. Overall occurrence rates of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes were 21.9% and 19.5%, respectively. Identical L. monocytogenes genotypes were found in the food processing environment (FPE), raw materials and in products. Interventions after the sampling events changed contamination scenarios substantially. The high diversity of globally, widely distributed L. monocytogenes genotypes was reduced by identifying the major sources of contamination. Although susceptible to a broad range of disinfectants and cleaners, one dominant L. monocytogenes sequence type (ST) 5 could not be eradicated from drains and floors. Significantly, intense humidity and steam could be observed in all rooms and water residues were visible on floors due to increased cleaning strategies. This could explain the high L. monocytogenes contamination of the FPE (drains, shoes and floors) throughout the study (15.8%). The outcome of a challenge experiment in fresh cheese showed that L. monocytogenes could survive after 14 days of storage at insufficient cooling temperatures (8 and 16 degrees C). All efforts to reduce L. monocytogenes environmental contamination eventually led to a transition from dynamic to stable contamination scenarios. Consequently, implementation of systematic environmental monitoring via in-house systems should either aim for total avoidance of FPE colonization, or emphasize a first reduction of L. monocyto genes to sites where contamination of the processed product is unlikely. Drying of surfaces after cleaning is highly recommended to facilitate the L. monocytogenes eradication. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

            "abstractNote": "This survey was conducted to investigate the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Listeria monocytogenes isolates in the environment of a pig slaughterhouse raw processing plant complex in western Romania. A total of 97 environmental samples from food contact (n = 60) and nonfood contact (it = 37) surfaces were examined with standard methods. The susceptibility of the isolates to 17 antimicrobial agents was determined with the VITEK 2 automated system. Overall, 25 (25.8%) samples were positive for L. monocytogenes, with recovery rates of 23.3% (n = 14) and 29.7% (n = 11) for food contact and nonfood contact surfaces, respectively. All 25 tested isolates were resistant to benzylpenicillin, imipenem, and fusidic acid. Resistance was observed to oxacillin (23 isolates; 92%), fosfomycin (23 isolates; 92%), clindamycin (22 isolates; 88%), rifampin (14 isolates; 56%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (12 isolates; 48%), tetracycline (11 isolates; 44%), and ciprofloxacin (1 isolate; 4%). No resistance was found to seven tested agents: gentamicin, moxifloxacin, erythromycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and tigecycline. All tested L. monocytogenes isolates were resistant to four to nine antimicrobial agents. These results indicate a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant L. monocytogenes isolates in this pork-processing environment, providing baseline information for hygienists and public health specialists.",

            "abstractNote": "Objectives: To compare Listeria monocytogenes strains obtained from food matrices with those from environmental samples in the same food processing plant.Methods and results: Between 2008 and 2012 the presence of L monocytogenes was evaluated in 2647 food samples. A total of 448 work surfaces and 92 equipment's were also evaluated from 6 plants which produce ready-to-eat (RTE) foods in Santiago, Chile. An additional selected sample of hand and nails samples was also obtained from 13 food handlers working in a sausage elaboration plant.As a whole L monocytogenes was present in 265 (10%) food samples and 22 (4%) environmental samples. The foods with highest recovery were red meats 14/60 (23%), poultry 223/1196 (19%), the remaining samples accounted a total of 27/1391 (2%). The environmental samples positive for L. monocytogenes were obtained from two food plants both the cheese 8/8 (100%) and from a fresh peaches exporter 3/3 (100%). Finally L. monocytogenes was isolated from 5/13 (38%) food handlers studied.Conclusions: The study confirms the presence of L. monocytogenes in different matrices, especially in meat and RTE products. Analyses conducted on work surfaces revealed that contamination comes mostly from both raw materials and surfaces in indirect contact with foods.Significance and impact of study: The study reinforces the need for companies to apply regulations related to food quality and safety systems (HACCP, Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points) to prevent L. monocytogenes contamination from food processing plants.

            "abstractNote": "During a recent outbreak of foodborne listeriosis which occurred in France in 1992, investigations were carried out in order to identify the plants associated with the production of contaminated products. These investigations were made in six ‘suspect’ delicatessen plants following the first epidemiological investigations, and in one ‘control plant’. The first visits were made during working operations. Two hundred and seventy samples were taken (‘environmental’ swabs, air samples, products), with 68% of the swabs being positive for Listeria monocytogenes in raw product areas, and 33% positives in the finished product area. The epidemic phagovar was identified in a single plant preparing pork tongues in aspic. The major causes of contamination identified were contact of cooked products with soiled surfaces, cross-contamination between ‘raw’ and ‘cooked’ channels and the inadequacy of cleaning and disinfection procedures. A second visit was also made to five plants to provide validation of their cleaning and disinfection procedures. Among 112 swabs collected, 17% of the samples from raw product surfaces and 7% from finished product surfaces were found to be positive. These results suggest that cleaning and disinfection procedures were unable to eliminate sources of L. monocytogenes when not correctly applied.",

            "abstractNote": "While there is considerable information available regarding Listeria monocytogenes contamination patterns in food processing plants, our understanding of L. monocytogenes contamination and transmission in retail operations is limited. We characterized 125 food, 40 environmental, and 342 human clinical L. monocytogenes isolates collected in New York State from 1997 to 2002 using automated ribotyping and hly allelic variation. All environmental isolates were obtained from retail establishments and the majority of food isolates (98 isolates) were obtained from foods that were prepared or handled at retail. Overall, food and/or environmental isolates from 50 different retail establishments were characterized. The 125 food and 40 environmental isolates were differentiated into 29 and 10 ribotypes, respectively. For 16 retail establishments, we found evidence for persistence of one or more specific L. monocytogenes strains as indicated by isolation of the same EcoRI ribotype from food or environmental samples collected in a given establishment on different days. The human isolates were differentiated into 48 ribotypes. Statistical analyses showed that two ribotypes were significantly (P < 0.0001) more common among food isolates as compared with human isolates. However, a total of 17 ribotypes found among the human clinical isolates were also found among the food and environmental isolates. We conclude that L. monocytogenes, including subtypes that have been linked to human disease, can persist in retail environments. Implementation of Listeria control procedures in retail operations, which process and handle products that permit the growth of L. monocytogenes, are thus a critical component of a farm-to-table L. monocytogenes control program.",

            "abstractNote": "Two commercially available all-in-one swab rapid detection systems for Listeria spp. (InSite Listeria Test and Path-Chek hygiene Listeria) were tested for performance in cheese production environments and salmon processing facilities. Sampling was conducted both on clean surfaces and during production. A total of 338 samples were taken using the swabs (175 in cheese environments, 163 in salmon environments). Conventional sampling using sterile cloths and standardized qualitative detection of Listeria spp. according to NMKL method no. 136 was performed in parallel from 64 sampling sites in the salmon processing facilities and 40 sampling sites in the cheese production facilities. Results showed that both rapid swab tests detected Listeria spp.; however, they returned significant amounts of false positives. Presence of Listeria spp. was indicated in 47% and 41% of all swabs in the cheese and salmon environments, respectively. Enrichment followed by selective plating and Listeria specific PCR confirmed none of the 82 presumptive positive swabs from the cheese environment and 16 of 67 presumptive positive swabs from the salmon environments, respectively. Further analysis showed that several other bacteria, including Enterococcus spp. and Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, were the source of false positive swab results. From salmon processing facilities, using cloth sampling and standard analyses, 22% Listeria positive sampling sites were confirmed compared to 9% and 11% positives obtained using InSite or Path-Chek detection systems. From the cheese production environments, no Listeria positive sites were confirmed using either swab or cloth sampling. In conclusion, the use of these rapid detection methods was not suited in the selected environments due to large numbers of false positives, caused by the background flora.",

Overall, 5,799 samples, including 835 environmental samples, 230 milk and milk product samples, and 4,734 aseptic half-udder foremilk samples were collected from 53 dairy farms in the dairy intensive area of Lower Austria. Farms were selected for the study because raw milk was processed to cheese that was sold directly to consumers. A total of 153 samples were positive for Listeria spp., yielding an overall prevalence of 2.6%; L. monocyto genes was found in 0.9% of the samples. Bulk tank milk, cheese, and half-udder samples were negative for Listeria spp. Because none of the sheep and goats tested positive from udder samples, L. monocytogenes mastitis was excluded as a significant source of raw milk contamination. L. monocytogenes was detected at 30.2% of all inspected farms. Swab samples from working boots and fecal samples had a significantly higher overall prevalence (P < 0.001) of L. monocytogenes (15.7 and 13.0%, respectively) than did swab samples from the milk processing environment (7.9%). A significant correlation was found between the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the animal and in the milk processing environment and the silage feeding practices. Isolation of L. monocytogenes was three to seven times more likely from farms where silage was fed to annuals throughout the year than from farms where silage was not fed to the animals.",

            "abstractNote": "The Smoked Seafood Working Group (SSWG), a collaboration of two US industry trade organizations, smoked seafood processors and academia, developed guidelines for controlling Listeria monocytogenes in smoked seafood operations. To minimize the potential for L. monocytogenes contamination of finished products, it is necessary to have sanitation procedures that prevent contamination of product contact surfaces and eliminate niches where L. monocytogenes can become established, grow, and persist. Environmental testing can be used to help identify problem areas or locate contamination sources in the plant, and to confirm that problem-solving procedures have been effective. Raw seafood and finished product testing can be used to evaluate raw product suppliers and verify the effectiveness of control procedures. Regular testing can also help to track performance over time and identify new sources or reservoirs of contamination in the processing plant environment. This paper describes considerations for developing effective environmental and product testing programs for L. monocytogenes and provides four examples to illustrate how testing programs could be structured for various types of smoked seafood processors.",

The isolates were differentiated by means of phenotypic characteristics. Furthermore, the genomic ApaI and SmaI fragment patterns of all isolates were examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE using SmaI and ApaI yielded 15 (Listeria monocytogenes), 20 (Listeria innocua) and six (Listeria welshimeri) pulsotypes. Of the environmental Listeria monocytogenes isolates the predominating PFGE-type B was clearly associated with processing area A whereas PFGE-type E predominated in the meat products. Moreover, the study showed the persistence of closely related Listeria strains over a 2-year period in the environment of this meat processing plant.",

A total of 218 samples were collected along the production line and environment. The CCPs identified were reception of raw milk, pasteurization, coagulation and storage. Thirteen samples were positive for Listeria; 9 samples were Listeria innocua, 2 were Listeria grayi and 2 were L. monocytogenes. In factory A, Listeria was found in 50% of raw milk samples, 33.3% of curd samples, 16.7% of pasteurized milk samples, 16.7% of cheese samples and 25% of rubber pipes used to transport the whey. The microorganism was not obtained from environmental samples in this plant. In factory B, Listeria was found in one sample of raw milk (16.7%) and in three samples of environment (17.6%) and L. monocytogenes was obtained from raw milk (16.7%) and the floor of the cheese refrigeration room (14.3%). Two serotypes, 4b and 1/2a, were observed among the strains of L. monocytogenes isolated, both which are frequently involved in outbreaks of food-borne listeriosis and sporadic cases of the disease all over the world.",

            "abstractNote": "The quality and safety of meat products can be estimated by assessing their contamination by hygiene indicator microorganisms and some foodborne pathogens, with Listeria monocytogenes as a major concern. To identify the main sources of microbiological contamination in the processing environment of three butcher shops, surface samples were obtained from the hands of employees, tables, knives, inside butcher displays, grinders, and meat tenderizers (24 samples per point). All samples were subjected to enumeration of hygiene indicator microorganisms and detection of L. monocytogenes, and the obtained isolates were characterized by their serogroups and virulence genes. The results demonstrated the absence of relevant differences in the levels of microbiological contamination among butcher shops; samples with counts higher than reference values indicated inefficiency in adopted hygiene procedures. A total of 87 samples were positive for Listeria spp. (60.4%): 22 from tables, 20 from grinders, 16 from knives, 13 from hands, 9 from meat tenderizers, and 7 from butcher shop displays. Thirty-one samples (21.5%) were positive for L. monocytogenes, indicating the presence of the pathogen in meat processing environments. Seventy-four L. monocytogenes isolates were identified, with 52 from serogroups 1/2c or 3c and 22 from serogroups 4b, 4d, 4a, or 4c. All 74 isolates were positive for hlyA, iap, plcA, actA, and internalins (inlA, inlB, inlC, and inlJ). The establishment of appropriate procedures to reduce microbial counts and control the spread of L. monocytogenes in the final steps of the meat production chain is of utmost importance, with obvious effects on the quality and safety of meat products for human consumption.",

            "abstractNote": "Postprocessing contamination in processing plants has historically been a significant source of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat delicatessen meats, and therefore a major cause of human listeriosis cases and outbreaks. Recent risk assessments suggest that a majority of human listeriosis cases linked to consumption of contaminated deli meats may be due to L. monocytogenes contamination that occurs at the retail level. To better understand the ecology and transmission of Listeria spp. in retail delicatessens, food and nonfood contact surfaces were tested for L. monocytogenes and other Listeria spp. in a longitudinal study conducted in 30 retail delis in three U.S. states. In phase I of the study, seven sponge samples were collected monthly for 3 months in 15 delis (5 delis per state) prior to start of daily operation; in phase II, 28 food contact and nonfood contact sites were sampled in each of 30 delis during daily operation for 6 months. Among the 314 samples collected during phase I, 6.8% were positive for L. monocytogenes. Among 4,503 samples collected during phase II, 9.5% were positive for L. monocytogenes; 9 of 30 delis showed low L. monocytogenes prevalence (<1%) for all surfaces. A total of 245 Listeria spp. isolates, including 184 Listeria innocua, 48 Listeria seeligeri, and 13 Listeria welshimeri were characterized. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to characterize 446 L. monocytogenes isolates. PFGE showed that for 12 of 30 delis, one or more PFGE types were isolated on at least three separate occasions, providing evidence for persistence of a given L. monocytogenes subtype in the delis. For some delis, PFGE patterns for isolates from nonfood contact surfaces were distinct from patterns for occasional food contact surface isolates, suggesting limited cross-contamination between these sites in some delis. This study provides longitudinal data on L. monocytogenes contamination patterns in retail delis, which should facilitate further development of control strategies in retail delis.",

A total of 409 environmental and food samples were collected during years 2011-2013. Listeria spp. contamination was observed in all the facilities, while L. monocytogenes was recovered from 12 facilities with a prevalence ranging between 3.0% and 22.6%. Floor drains were the most contaminated sampling sites (48.8% of positive samples), serving as harbourage site for subsequent contamination. Out of 616 isolates, 277 (45.0%) were Listeria innocua, 274 (44.5%) L. monocytogenes, 41(6.6%) Listeria ivanovii, 14 (2.3%) Listeria welshimeri and 10 (1.6%) Listeria gravyi. Serotyping carried out by PCR and agglutination method for L monocytogenes revealed that 169 strains (61.7%) were serotype 1/2a, 65 (23.7%) 4b, 20 (7.3%) 1/2b",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria monocytogenes can grow and multiply in various food matrices and cause severe human illness. Apart from the influence on consumer health, L. monocytogenes contamination of ready-to-eat (RTE) food products causes major economic losses due to product recalls. Control of foodborne pathogens in RTE food products is a challenge, specifically in foods that cannot undergo a heat-treatment during processing. The aim of this study was to develop control strategies for the management of L. monocytogenes in an avocado processing facility, additional to a quality control system. An in-house monitoring system (IMS) was established to test specifically for Listeria spp. in the final products and processing environment, including floors, equipment, work areas and personnel. Guacamole and environmental samples were collected and tested on-site for Listeria with the ISO 11290-1 method. Based on the prevalence of Listeria, the facility introduced new strategies in processing to counter cross contamination. Results from the 2014 guacamole production season showed almost complete eradication of Listeria spp. in final products (0.17%, n = 1170) and the processing facility (0.79%, n = 1520). This is a major achievement since the highest incidence of Listeria spp. over a period of five years was measured at 11.39% (n = 948) in the final product during the 2013 season and 13.44% (n = 1927) in the processing facility in 2011. These results indicate that successful management of Listeria spp. in an avocado processing facility can be accomplished with in-house monitoring of the listerial population and subsequent adjustments to the processing system.

The samples were taken from equipment, personnel and the environment after cleaning procedures and during food processing, as well as from raw materials and products from six meat, two poultry and five seafood processing plants located in the Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Altogether, 25 different ribotypes (RTs) were generated. Two RTs occurred in the samples from all three food sectors–meat, poultry and seafood. Four RTs occurred in meat and poultry plant samples and other four RTs occurred in meat and seafood plant samples. Five RTs occurred only in meat plant samples, five only in poultry plant samples and five only in seafood plant samples. Eight of the thirteen plants had their own in-house L. monocytogenes ribotype. There was geographical differences between the RTs, but no correlation between RTs and food sectors was detected. The discrimination power of automated ribotyping was satisfactory to trace the contamination sources in the food processing plants clearly indicating the sites at which improved cleaning procedures were necessary. In addition, it was possible to screen a large number of isolates with two instruments located at different institutes and to make a reliable combination of the results.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: A bacteriological assessment of the environment and food products at different stages of processing was conducted during the manufacture of ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken franks, chicken bologna and bacon at a large meat processing plant in Trinidad, West Indies. METHODS: Samples of air, surfaces (swabs), raw materials, and in-process and finished food products were collected during two separate visits for each product type and subjected to qualitative or quantitative analysis for bacterial zoonotic pathogens and fecal indicator organisms. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen detected in pre-cooked products (mean counts = 0.66, 1.98, and 1.95 log10CFU/g for franks, bologna, and bacon, respectively). This pathogen was also found in unacceptable levels in 4 (16.7%) of 24 post-cooked samples. Fifty percent (10 of 20) of pre-cooked mixtures of bacon and bologna were contaminated with Listeria spp., including four with L. monocytogenes. Pre-cooked mixtures of franks and bologna also contained E. coli (35 and 0.72 log10 CFU/g, respectively) while 5 (12.5%) of 40 pre-cooked mixtures of chicken franks had Salmonella spp. Aerobic bacteria exceeded acceptable international standards in 46 (82.1%) of 56 pre-cooked and 6 (16.7%) of 36 post-cooked samples. Both pre-and post-cooking air and surfaces had relatively high levels of aerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and coliforms, including equipment and gloves of employees. A drastic decrease in aerobic counts and Staphylococcus aureus levels following heat treatment and subsequent increase in counts of these bacteria are suggestive of post-cooking contamination. CONCLUSION: A relatively high level of risk exists for microbial contamination of RTE meats at the food plant investigated and there is a need for enhancing the quality assurance programs to ensure the safety of consumers of products manufactured at this plant.",

The residual microflora contaminating the surfaces and the equipment were analysed after cleaning and disinfection procedures. All the PU environments were colonised at various levels by spoilage and technological microflora with excessive contamination levels in some of the PUs. Sporadic contamination by pathogenic microflora was recorded. Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes were detected in 4.8% and 6.7% of the samples, respectively, and Staphylococcus aureus was enumerated in 6.1% of the samples. Several critical points were identified, such as the machines for S. aureus and the tables and the knives for L. monocytogenes; this knowledge is crucial for the improvement of hygiene control systems in small and traditional meat processing industries. The variability of the residual contamination emphasized the different cleaning, disinfecting and manufacturing practices routinely followed by these small-scale processing units.",

To follow this last recommendation, the use of quantitative microbiological risk assessment is an appealing approach to link new risk-based metrics to management options that may be applied by food operators. Through a specific case study, Listeria monocytogenes in soft cheese made from pasteurized milk, the objective of the present article is to practically show how quantitative risk assessment could be used to direct potential intervention strategies at different food processing steps. Based on many assumptions, the model developed estimates the risk of listeriosis at the moment of consumption taking into account the entire manufacturing process and potential sources of contamination. From pasteurization to consumption, the amplification of a primo-contamination event of the milk, the fresh cheese or the process environment is simulated, over time, space, and between products, accounting for the impact of management options, such as hygienic operations and sampling plans. A sensitivity analysis of the model will help orientating data to be collected prioritarily for the improvement and the validation of the model. What-if scenarios were simulated and allowed for the identification of major parameters contributing to the risk of listeriosis and the optimization of preventive and corrective measures.",

Thirteen dried sausage processing plants were sampled at two different times of the working day. The studies were repeated twice to evaluate the persistence of the pathogen. A total of 1029 samples were collected. Among swabbed samples, 15% were positive before the beginning of the working day and 47.3% during working day. Results showed that effectiveness of cleaning and disinfecting operations could be linked with the complexity of processing lines and machines used. The presence of L. monocytogenes in mixed meat amounted to 71.6% of the collected samples. A decrease of the contamination rate in dry sausage was noted, particularly during the drying stage. Nevertheless 3 sausages studied presented a low contamination rate (<3 cfu/g) when ready for consumption. A total of 996 strains of L. monocytogenes were characterised by biochemical tests and serotyping. A majority of isolates were 1/2a (49.5%), 1/2c (19.5%) and 1/2b (13%) strains. A high heterogeneity of serotypes was observed in all plants, raw meat and in sausages during maturation.",

            "abstractNote": "The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes represents a major concern to the food industry and particularly to producers of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods because of the severity of human listeriosis infections and because of the ubiquitous nature of this organism. Although several studies on the prevalence and sources of L. monocytogenes in various RTE seafoods have been conducted, limited information is available on the presence and potential sources of this organism in RTE crawfish products. We thus monitored the presence of L. monocytogenes and other Listeria spp. in the processing environment, in raw, whole crawfish, and in cooked crawfish meat from two processing plants. Samples were collected from the two plants throughout one crawfish season (April to June 2001) at 5 and 8 separate visits, respectively. At each visit, 6 raw, whole crawfish, 6 finished product samples (crawfish meat), and 14 mid- or end-of-processing environmental sponge samples were collected and tested for L. monocytogenes and Listeria spp. Of the 337 samples tested, 31 contained Listeria spp. Although Listeria innocua was the predominant Listeria spp. found (20 samples), four samples were positive for L. monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes was detected in three raw material samples and in one environmental sample. Listeria spp. were found in 29.5% of raw, whole crawfish (n = 78) and in 4.4% of environmental samples (n = 181) but in none of the finished product samples. Among the environmental samples, Listeria spp. were found in 15.4% of the drains (n = 39) and in 5.1% of the employee contact surfaces (gloves and aprons) (n = 39) but in none of the samples from food contact surfaces. Even though a high prevalence of Listeria spp. was detected on raw materials, it appears that the heat treatment during the processing of crawfish and the practices preventing postprocessing recontamination can significantly reduce Listeria contamination of RTE crawfish meat.",

            "abstractNote": "Four smoked fish processing plants were used as a model system to characterize Listeria monocytogenes contamination patterns in ready-to-eat food production environments. Each of the four plants was sampled monthly for approximately 1 year. At each sampling, four to six raw fish and four to six finished product samples were collected from corresponding lots. In addition, 12 to 14 environmental sponge samples were collected several hours after the start of production at sites selected as being likely contamination sources. A total of 234 raw fish, 233 finished products, and 553 environmental samples were tested. Presumptive Listeria spp. were isolated from 16.7% of the raw fish samples, 9.0% of the finished product samples, and 27.3% of the environmental samples. L. monocytogenes was isolated from 3.8% of the raw fish samples (0 to 10%, depending on the plant), 1.3% of the finished product samples (0 to 3.3%), and 12.8% of the environmental samples (0 to 29.8%). Among the environmental samples, L. monocytogenes was found in 23.7% of the samples taken from drains, 4.8% of the samples taken from food contact surfaces, 10.4% of the samples taken from employee contact surfaces (aprons, hands, and door handles), and 12.3% of the samples taken from other nonfood contact surfaces. Listeria spp. were isolated from environmental samples in each of the four plants, whereas L. monocytogenes was not found in any of the environmental samples from one plant. Overall, the L. monocytogenes prevalence in the plant environment showed a statistically significant (P < 0.0001) positive relationship with the prevalence of this organism in finished product samples. Automated EcoRI ribotyping differentiated 15 ribotypes among the 83 L. monocytogenes isolates. For each of the three plants with L. monocytogenes-positive environmental samples, one or two ribotypes seemed to persist in the plant environment during the study period. In one plant, a specific L. monocytogenes ribotype represented 44% of the L. monocytogenes-positive environmental samples and was also responsible for one of the two finished product positives found in this plant. In another plant, a specific L. monocytogenes ribotype persisted in the raw fish handling area. However, this ribotype was never isolated from the finished product area in this plant, indicating that this operation has achieved effective separation of raw and finished product areas. Molecular subtyping methods can help identify plant-specific L. monocytogenes contamination routes and thus provide the knowledge needed to implement improved L. monocytogenes control strategies.",

            "abstractNote": "There is increasing awareness that certain pathogens can persist in food processing environments, contaminate the food and lead to foodborne illness. Two pathogens are of particular concern, salmonellae and Listeria monocytogenes. Many examples could be cited where these pathogens have become established in the food processing environment and resulted in the contamination of multiple lots of food produced over long periods of time (weeks, months, years). As these events have occurred, large numbers of consumers have been exposed before the offending food could be identified and removed from the market. Despite the best efforts of facility management to ensure compliance with GHP it is now evident that traditional techniques that rely on visual inspection or testing for indicators (e.g., total plate count, coliforms) to assess cleanliness are not adequate to detect persistent pathogens. This presentation describes how an environmental sampling program can be established for this purpose. The principles outlined also are applicable for controlling microorganisms that lead to unacceptable spoilage of food.",

Of particular concern are outbreaks of a few to several hundred scattered cases involving an unusually virulent strain that has become established in the food-processing environment and contaminates multiple lots of food over days or months of production. The risk is highest when growth occurs in a food before it is eaten by a susceptible population. The information presented in this paper provides the basis for the establishment of an environmental sampling program, the organization and interpretation of the data generated by this program, and the response to Listeria-positive results. Results from such a program, including examples of niches, are provided. Technologies and regulatory policies that can further enhance the safety of ready-to-eat foods are discussed.",

Because of the serious nature of listeriosis in the susceptible population, industry must take stringent measures to control L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods in which the organism can grow. This document provides practical guidelines for preventing recontamination of products with L. monocytogenes, including controls directed toward preventing contamination of product surfaces and preventing the establishment and growth of the organism in niches in the plant environment. Although this document focuses on refrigerated, ready-to-eat products that support the growth of L. monocytogenes, the guidelines may be applied to other products to minimize contamination. The guidelines, which cover General Considerations, Processing Operations, Packaging and Storage Operations, Equipment Considerations, General Plant Sanitation, and Employee Personal Hygiene, also provide general guidance on environmental monitoring programs that use indicator organisms such as generic Listeria to verify the effectiveness of the L. monocytogenes control program.",

            "abstractNote": "SUMMARY: The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry inspection regulations by establishing food safety performance standards for all ready-to-eat (RTE) and all partially heat-treated meat and poultry products. The proposed performance standards set forth levels of pathogen reduction and limits on pathogen growth that official meat and poultry establishments must achieve in order to produce unadulterated products, but allow the use of customized, plant-specific processing procedures. The proposed RTE performance standards apply to all RTE meat and poultry products, which can be categorized as follows: Dried products (e.g., beef or poultry jerky); salt-cured products (e.g. country ham); fermented products (e.g., salami and Lebanon bologna); cooked and otherwise processed products (e.g., beef and chicken burritos, corned beef, pastrami, poultry rolls, and turkey franks); and thermally- processed, commercially sterile products (e.g., canned spaghetti with meat balls and canned corned beef hash). Although FSIS routinely samples and tests some RTE products for the presence of pathogens prior to distribution, there are no specific regulatory pathogen reduction requirements for most of these products. The proposed performance standards will help ensure the safety of these products; give establishments the incentive and flexibility to adopt innovative, science-based food safety processing procedures and controls; and provide objective, measurable standards that can be verified by Agency oversight. FSIS also is proposing environmental testing requirements intended to reduce the incidence of Listeria monocytogenes in RTE meat and poultry products. Specifically, FSIS is proposing to require establishments that produce RTE meat and poultry products to test food contact surfaces for Listeria spp. to verify that they are controlling the presence of L. monocytogenes within their processing environments. Establishments that have developed and implemented HACCP controls for L. monocytogenes would be exempt from these testing requirements. Finally, FSIS is proposing to eliminate its regulations that require that both RTE and not-ready-to eat pork and products containing pork be treated to destroy trichina (Trichinella spiralis). These requirements are inconsistent with HACCP and some will be unnecessary if FSIS makes final the proposed performance standards for RTE meat and poultry products",

However, fresh and fresh-cut produce handling offers some unique opportunities and challenges, which will be described in depth in this guidance. This guidance is intended to be applicable to all fresh and fresh-cut produce operations, including field and field packing, packinghouse and other produce handling operations including re-pack, value-added and transport/distribution to retail/foodservice, recognizing that vulnerability to L. monocytogenes contamination and entrenchment in equipment or a facility will depend on the type(s) and production region of the commodities handled and the nature of the handling. All produce handling operations are encouraged to use this guidance 1) to determine their level of vulnerability to Listeria harborage that may lead to produce contamination and 2) if vulnerable, to develop and implement an effective Listeria monitoring and control program.",

Only 2-7% of the carcasses and 0-10% of the environmental samples in the 'clean' part of the pork slaughterline were found to be positive for L. monocytogenes. The incidence of L. monocytogenes was increased after chilling and cutting. In the cutting room 11-36% of the primal cuts and 71-100% of the environmental samples were found positive for L. monocytogenes. Our findings indicate that contamination of pork meat with L. monocytogenes originates from the processing environment of the chilling or cutting room. The incidence of L. monocytogenes in the bovine cutting and meat processing line (0-60%) was lower than in the porcine cutting and meat processing line (11-100%).",

Plants employ a variety of sanitation and other food safety practices to control Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Listeria and other pathogens. Most plants sanitize hand tools during operations (89%) and treat drains with sanitizers for pathogen control (84%). About 64% of plants have purchase specifications to control pathogens in raw meat and poultry. However, less than one-third of plants apply antimicrobial chemicals. 71% of plants conduct voluntary microbiological testing, and 70% conduct environmental sampling. Analysis by HACCP size suggests that large and small plants are more likely than very small plants to use many types of food safety practices and technologies (P < 0.01). Furthermore, plants that produce ready-to-eat products or inputs to further processing are more likely than plants with no such production to use some types of food safety practices and technologies. These findings can be used to establish a baseline of current industry practices, to conduct analyses of plant practices that might contribute to risk-based inspection initiatives, and to conduct required economic analyses of proposed regulations.",

            "abstractNote": "The contamination routes of Listeria monocytogenes in cold-smoked salmon processing plants were investigated by analyzing 3,585 samples from products (produced in 1995, 1996, 1998, and 1999) and processing environments (samples obtained in 1998 and 1999) of two Danish smokehouses. The level of product contamination in plant I varied from 31 to 85%, and no L. monocytogenes was found on raw fish (30 fish were sampled). In plant II, the levels of both raw fish and product contamination varied from 0 to 25% (16 of 185 raw fish samples and 59 of 1,000 product samples were positive for L. monocytogenes). A total of 429 strains of L. monocytogenes were subsequently compared by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiling, and 55 different RAPD types were found. The RAPD types detected on the products were identical to types found on the processing equipment and in the processing environment, suggesting that contamination of the final product (cold-smoked salmon) in both plants (but primarily in plant I) was due to contamination during processing rather than to contamination from raw fish. However, the possibility that raw fish was an important source of contamination of the processing equipment and environment could not be excluded. Contamination of the product occurred in specific areas (the brining and slicing areas). In plant I, the same RAPD type (RAPD type 12) was found over a 4-year period, indicating that an established in-house flora persisted and was not eliminated by routine hygienic procedures. In plant II, where the prevalence of L. monocytogenes was much lower, no RAPD type persisted over long periods of time, and several different L. monocytogenes RAPD types were isolated. This indicates that persistent strains may be avoided by rigorous cleaning and sanitation; however, due to the ubiquitous nature of the organism, sporadic contamination occurred. A subset of strains was also typed by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and amplified fragment length polymorphism profiling, and these methods confirmed the type division obtained by RAPD profiling.",

It can to persist in the food processing environmental for extended periods of time being able to contaminate the final product. The aim of this study was to trace the contamination route of L. monocytogenes on a fresh mixed sausage processing line, from raw material to the final product. The isolates obtained were characterized by serotyping and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the restriction enzymes ApaI and AscI. L. monocytogenes was detected in 25% of the samples. The samples of raw material were not contaminated, however, the microorganism was detected in 21% of the environmental samples (food contact and non-food contact), 20.8% of the equipments, 20% of the food worker's hands, 40% of the mass ready to packaging and in all the final products samples, demonstrating that the contamination of final product occurred during the processing and the importance of cross contamination. PFGE yielded 22 pulsotypes wich formed 7 clusters, and serotyping yielded 3 serotypes and 1 serogroup, however, the presence of serotypes 4b and 1/2b in the final product is of great concern for public health. The tracing of contamination showed that some strains are adapted and persisted in the processing environment in this industry.",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria contamination in processing plant environments is a major issue for the seafood industry worldwide; faster and more reliable results are therefore desired for early detection and monitoring of environmental Listeria spp. This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the prevalence and diversity of Listeria spp., and to evaluate a rapid detection method, the 3M Molecular Detection Assay (MDA) Listeria, for its ability to detect Listeria spp. in environmental samples from seafood processing plants. Duplicate environmental sponge samples (n = 444) were collected from 152 different sites within three seafood processing plants, and analyzed for Listeria spp. by the MDA method (after 26 and 48 h of enrichment) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual method. Overall, detection of Listeria spp. by the two methods did not differ significantly (p > 0.05); 11(4.9%) and 13 (5.9%) samples were positive for Listeria spp. by the MDA and FDA-BAM method, respectively. The sensitivity of the MDS was 87.0% (95% CI: 77.4-96.6%), specificity was 97.6% (95% CI: 95.5-99.7%), accuracy was 95.3%, and the positive predictive value was 89.4% (95% CI: 80.5-98.2%). Classification of 19 Listeria isolates by partial SigB sequencing analysis identified three allelic types. Twelve of these isolates were ATs 58 and 60 which were classified as Listeria monocytogenes lineage I and serotypes 1/2b, 3b, 4b, 4d, 4e, by multiplex-PCR serotyping. Six Listeria isolates were classified as Listeria innocua (AT31). Our data show that the 3M Molecular Detection Assay Listeria provides rapid and reliable results for detection and monitoring of Listeria spp., which are important for seafood processing plants. Effective Listeria monitoring programs will allow for improved development of Listeria control measures in order to minimize cross-contamination in finished products. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The basic idea is to control the introduction of L. monocytogenes into the food processing environment, preventing the pathogen from contaminating the food under processing. The Austrian Listeria monitoring program comprises four levels of investigation, dealing with routine monitoring of samples and consequences of finding a positive sample. Preventive quality control concepts attempt to detect a foodborne hazard along the food processing chain, prior to food delivery, retailing, and consumption. The implementation of a preventive food safety concept provokes a deepened insight by the manufacturers into problems concerning food safety. The development of preventive quality assurance strategies contributes to the national food safety status and protects public health.",

Association of possible factors contributing to the presence of Listeria was analyzed. Of 922 samples, 111 (12%) were positive for Listeria spp. Listeria monocytogenes and L. innocua were the only species isolated. Of 39 plants sampled, L. monocytogenes was the only species recovered from 5 (12.8%) plants and L. innocua was the only species recovered from 13 (33.3%) plants. Both species were isolated from 9 (23.1%) plants. No Listeria was isolated from 12 (30.8%) plants. A minimum of five colonies was identified from each positive site. Only one species was identified from 105 of the 111 positive sites (94.6%). There was a statistically significant association of culture results from selected sites in plants with corresponding drain cultures; however, from 9 of 106 (8.5%) site/ drain combinations no Listeria was isolated from the drain when the selected sites were positive. Type of product received and type of pasteurization did not influence recovery of Listeria from a plant. There was a significant association with size of the plant and recovery of Listeria. Level of sanitation and extent of environmental contamination control program (ECCP), individually, were not associated with recovery of Listeria from a plant. However, the rate of recovery of Listeria from plants with above average sanitation and excellent or moderate ECCP (N=7) was 6.81%, whereas the recovery rate from plants with below average sanitation and slight or no ECCP (N=7) was 27.5%. The highest recovery rates of Listeria in FMP plants were in batch flavoring, freezing and ingredient blending, and packaging filling areas.",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that can cause listeriosis, a severe disease that can lead to septicemia, meningitis, and spontaneous abortion. Ongoing efforts are needed to further reduce the incidence of listeriosis, due to its high mortality rate. The focus of this report is the use of a risk-based approach to identify strategies that will have the greatest impact on reducing foodborne listeriosis. A continuum of risk for listeriosis is observed in the human population, ranging from exquisitely sensitive groups, who are highly immunocompromised and at very high risk of listeriosis, through the normal healthy population younger than 65 years of age, who appear to have a minimal risk for listeriosis. In addition, unique subpopulations may exist; for example, pregnant Latina women appear to have a higher risk of listeriosis than pregnant women of other ethnic groups, most likely due to consumption of contaminated soft cheeses such as queso fresco and queso blanco. The International Life Sciences Institute Risk Science Institute Expert Panel concluded that certain foods pose a high risk for causing listeriosis. High-risk foods have all of the following properties: (1) have the potential for contamination with L. monocytogenes; (2) support the growth of L. monocytogenes to high numbers; (3) are ready to eat; (4) require refrigeration; and (5) are stored for an extended period of time. Control strategies are needed in the food chain from preharvest through consumption to minimize the likelihood that food will become contaminated by L. monocytogenes and to prevent the growth of the organism to high numbers. The Expert Panel identified three main strategies for ensuring continuous improvement in reducing foodborne listeriosis: (1) preventing contamination of foods with L. monocytogenes; (2) preventing growth of L. monocytogenes to high numbers in foods; and (3) science-based education messages targeted to susceptible populations and their caregivers. Of these strategies, the Expert Panel concluded that preventing growth of L. monocytogenes to high numbers would have the greatest impact in reducing cases of listeriosis. Dose-response models predict that the risk of listeriosis increases as the number of organisms in a food increases and can be used as a scientific basis for a target level below which the organism should be reduced to minimize the likelihood of listeriosis in high-risk populations. This requires implementation of effective food safety control measures and ensuring that these control strategies are consistently met. Most effective strategies to control L. monocytogenes in high-risk foods include (1) good manufacturing practices, sanitation standard operating procedures, and hazard analysis critical control point programs to minimize environmental L. monocytogenes contamination and to prevent cross-contamination in processing plants and at retail; (2) an intensive environmental sampling program in plants processing high-risk foods and an effective corrective action plan to reduce the likelihood of contamination of high-risk foods; (3) time and temperature controls throughout the entire distribution and storage period, including establishing acceptable storage times of foods that support growth of L. monocytogenes to high numbers; (4) reformulating foods to prevent or retard the growth of L. monocytogenes; and (5) using postpackaging treatments to destroy L. monocytogenes on products.Science-based education and risk communication strategies aimed at susceptible populations and focused on high-risk foods should b delivered through health care providers or other credible sources of information. Exquisitely sensitive consumers may become ill when exposed to low numbers of L. monocytogenes or other opportunistic pathogens, so reducing the risk to this population could be achieved by maintaining them on restricted low-microbe diets during those periods when they are most severely immunocompromised. High-risk individuals (i.e., the elderly, pregnant women, and most immunocompromised individuals) should be provided with guidance on healthy eating, including specific information on high-risk foods that they should avoid, and strategies to reduce their risk, such as thorough cooking, avoidance of cross-contamination, and short-term refrigerated storage of cooked perishable foods. Those at low risk for listeriosis should receive information on safe food handling practices, preferably starting at a preschool age.",

Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from only two of 41 environmental samples obtained in the plant. Among production line product samples analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control, 0 to 8% of samples from the production stages before the peeler-conveyor belt apparatus were positive for the case strain of L. monocytogenes, whereas 12 of 14 (86%) samples collected from this apparatus were positive (p <0.001). The most probable number (MPN) of L. monocytogenes in finished product purchased from a retail outlet was less than 0.3 per gram; however, the opened package of franks from the case patient's refrigerator had an MPN of >1100 per gram. These data suggest that systematic culturing and analysis of products and production facilities may help identify appropriate interventions to reduce L. monocytogenes contamination in food processing plants and contribute to control of L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat products.",

            "abstractNote": "A longitudinal study was conducted to track Listeria contamination patterns in ready-to-eat meats from six small or very small meat processing plants located in three states over 1 year. A total of 688 environmental sponge samples were collected from nonfood contact surfaces during bimonthly visits to each plant. Overall, L. monocytogenes was isolated from 42 (6.1%) environmental samples, and its prevalence ranged from 1.7 to 10.8% across different plants. Listeria spp., other than L. monocytogenes, were isolated from 9.5% of samples overall, with the prevalence ranging from 1.5 to 18.3% across different plants. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes correlated well with that of other Listeria spp. for some but not all plants. One L. monocytogenes isolate representing each positive sample was characterized by molecular serotyping, EcoRI ribotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing. Seven sample sites tested positive for L. monocytogenes on more than one occasion, and the same ribotype was detected more than once at five of these sites. Partial sigB sequencing was used to speciate other Listeria spp. isolates and assign an allelic type to each isolate. Other Listeria spp. were isolated more than once from 14 sample sites, and the same sigB allelic type was recovered at least twice from seven of these sites. One plant was colonized by an atypical hemolytic L. innocua strain. Our findings indicate that small and very small meat processing plants that produce ready-to-eat meat products are characterized by a varied prevalence of Listeria, inconsistent correlation between contamination by L. monocyto genes and other Listeria spp., and a unique Listeria molecular ecology.",

            "abstractNote": "Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne bacterial pathogen. Immunocompromised patients are at higher risk of developing invasive listeriosis with high fatality rates. After notification of two patients with Listeria that had stayed in the same hospital (hospital A) before the onset of infection, we began an investigation to ascertain the extent of the outbreak, identify its source and prevent further infections. We conducted active case finding by contacting hospital A, reviewing medical records and retrospectively investigating listeriosis notifications from the German surveillance system (SurvNet). The kitchen (hospital A) and its meat supplier (company X) were inspected and environmental and food samples were taken for microbiological testing. All isolates of L. monocytogenes, together with patient and food-related isolates from Baden-Wurttemberg 2006 to 2008, were characterised by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Altogether, 16 cases of listeriosis were identified. Serotype 4b with the indistinguishable PFGE patterns (AscI 17a/ApaI 10) was detected from nine patients, five environmental and three ready-to-eat scalded sausage samples from company X, and two food samples from hospital A. All 11 patient cases linked to hospital A were immunosuppressed and were regularly served food during their hospital stay. Ten of these patients received corticosteroids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Five cases were fatal. Our investigations indicate that ready-to-eat scalded sausages from company X caused this outbreak of listeriosis. Hospital food suppliers should guarantee the absence of L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat products, controlled through optimised quality assurance.",

We hypothesized that specific L. monocytogenes strains may be better adapted to specific environmental niches in the processing environment. L. monocytogenes contamination patterns were identified by the collection of 686 and 267 samples from the processing environments: raw fish and products of four fish smokehouses and four fish slaughterhouses, respectively. Samples were collected both during production and after cleaning and disinfection. Typically, these samplings were separated by 1 to 3 months. Sampling sites were targeted toward areas likely to harbor the bacterium. L. monocytogenes was isolated from 213 samples, and one strain from each positive sample was typed by RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) analysis with four different primers. The 213 strains were divided into 37 RAPD types. One RAPD type was predominant; 86 of 213 strains belonged to this type. This type was found in three smokehouses and two slaughterhouses and was predominant in three of these plants. A subset of 35 strains was also analyzed by amplified fragment length polymorphism typing, which confirmed the genetic similarity of the groups. Moreover, strains of the dominant RAPD type were indistinguishable from strains isolated frequently from smoked fish products 10 years ago. One smokehouse was surveyed for a year and a half, and the dominant RAPD type persisted throughout the survey period and accounted for 94 of 118 isolates. Our study indicates that strains of L. monocytogenes that are genetically very closely related may be especially adapted to colonizing the processing equipment or especially resistant to cleaning and disinfection.",
